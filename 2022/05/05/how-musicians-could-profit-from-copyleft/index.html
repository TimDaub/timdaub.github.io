  <div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Few people intuitively understand Copyleft. Especially in all
peripheral parts of the software development industry, people are
(painfully) unaware, but more importantly, I seldom see someone showing
a deep understanding of Copyleft.</p>
<p>But Copyleft, despite many now disagreeing, makes the world go round.
&quot;It eats the world,&quot; as a loaded baldheaded white man would say. So why
is it that the ideas of Copyleft and, more importantly, its sound
understanding is lacking in so many knowledge-work-based and creative
industries?</p>
<p>In the following article, I want to outline the importance of
Copyleft licensing in the software development industry. I&apos;ll
purposefully conflate the ideas of Copyleft licensing with other,
higher-level, open-source software principles too. I&apos;ll do that
intentionally to paint a decisive picture for everyone working outside
my industry, towards a better understanding of Copyleft - e.g., in the
music industry.</p>
<h2 id="please-sample-my-code">Please &quot;sample&quot; my code!</h2>
<p>Contrary to, e.g. musicians, software developers happily upload their
painstakingly-created code to public platforms. Consider this; software
developers are among the best-paid knowledge workers globally. In places
like Silicon Valley, they take home unheard-of paychecks and equity.</p>
<p>Still, if you know one, you&apos;re likely aware that on some Saturdays
and Sundays, they&apos;ll cancel your brunch dates to instead sit in front of
their computer just to fix this one bug in their open-source
library.</p>
<p>If we were to put a nominal value on the amount of free work being
pushed online to GitHub; If we summed up all the accumulated hours of
software developers dwelling on code in their undies on the weekend -
just to give it away &quot;for free,&quot; every business person and their
assistants would be losing their minds! It&apos;s anarchy! How can they do
that?! Aren&apos;t they afraid of someone stealing their work??</p>
<p>But that&apos;s where I think it is important to understand that coming
from another industry, e.g., music, how software developers think when
shipping open-source code has to be considered vastly different from,
e.g., musicians.</p>
<p>While Kanye et al. may go complete batshit about seeing their work
sampled without prior legal agreement and moral attribution, as a
software engineer working under the principles of Copyleft, my highest
goal is &quot;developing a sample and then promoting it such that everyone
uses it.&quot;</p>
<p>Software, being, fortunately, a rather recently developed art, gladly
had genious contributors like Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, and
others who made sure that attribution (git and package managers),
licensing (e.g., GPL), and free speech are built into the free (as in
libre) software production stack.</p>
<p>In open-source software development, developers want their code to be
&quot;sampled&quot; (or referenced) as broadly as possible. It furthers their
brand and credibility; it&apos;s their default as proper attribution is
always given.</p>
<p>So it happens that when engineers write code &quot;for free&quot; and everyone
uses it, a rather direct incentive comes into play: they are invited to
join higher-paid or higher-status jobs. They earn more money, are more
popular, and sometimes, they even have to work less.</p>
<p>Open-source software developers like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mxstbr.com/">mxstbr</a>, the creator of the react
boilerplate, have made a professional career out of a single significant
open source contribution. That guy wrote code that 1% of the worldwide
web now uses, and he probably never made a penny <em>directly</em> from
that react boilerplate OSS.</p>
<h2 id="brand-building-and-copyleft-are-better-than-copyright.">Brand-building
and Copyleft are better than Copyright.</h2>
<p>Sure, particularly business types in the software industry may now
say that with open source software, a company cannot sustain its
business. They&apos;ll enumerate countless examples where OSS hasn&apos;t worked
out. Or, they&apos;ll list the numerous instances where software is
exclusively reserved under copyright laws and generates shittons of
cash.</p>
<p>And it&apos;s probably true: More money is directly made from exclusively
copyrighted software.</p>
<p>But for me, as an individual, I have particular aims for my career,
those being the freedom to explore my curiosity while still making a
good salary - building a brand and contributing to the global catalog of
OSS works well.</p>
<p>Moreover, I know for a fact, though, that there are many others like
me profiting from their work being openly accessible. After all, the
world runs on open-source software in 2022. There&apos;s no app, no website,
phone, or car that isn&apos;t using the undies-generated &quot;free&quot; code. As much
as you cannot escape technology&apos;s accelerationism, for sure, you won&apos;t
be able to run from having to use open-source software.</p>
<p>Today, writing open-source software and building an online brand is a
well-paid and prosperous career any engineer should consider.</p>
<h2 id="oss-is-speech-and-speech-doesnt-have-a-price.">OSS is speech,
and speech doesn&apos;t have a price.</h2>
<p>But developing open-source software goes far beyond just
brand-building and making money as an individual. Albeit cynically (and
falsely) derided, Stallman&apos;s Free Software Definition and its
proclamation of software being &quot;free&quot; as in &quot;free speech&quot; (and not
&quot;free&quot; as &quot;free of charge&quot;) is paramount to creating a plane of freedom
for all contributors.</p>
<p>It is here where I reference back to the article&apos;s beginning and when
I said that few truly understand the power of Copyleft. On other
occurrences when it was clear, I&apos;ve tried to make a similar argument,
e.g., when Facebook set out to build the metaverse, and <a href="/2021/11/03/principles-for-the-metaverse/">I said that a stock
company isn&apos;t capable of creating a public good like the metaverse</a>.
Only a FOSS approach could achieve that.</p>
<p>Copyleft software licenses, particularly the GNU General Public
License, allow software developers to create a work, or a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/hintjens/socialarchitecture">social
architecture</a>, much greater than their individual contributions.</p>
<p>The GPL license allows each contributor to fully retain their
Copyright while making their work available under viral conditions. Any
other user is permitted to use the GPL-licensed software in other
GPL-licensed software, while the license specifically disallows
distributing GPL-licensed code in proprietarily distributed
software.</p>
<p>The beauty of this construct is in viewing every single contribution
of a repository as a GPL-licensed commitment from distinct individuals.
It is this viewpoint that makes clear the mandatoriness of GPL&apos;s
virality and the incentives it creates.</p>
<p>A GPL contributor retains Copyright, and since their contribution can
likewise only be used within GPL-licensed, an old code repository can
grow into a convoluted monster of individual code donations.</p>
<p>It is this property that makes contributing to knowledge work under
Copyleft so powerful. Because similarly to how an employee might work
towards furthering their company&apos;s interest in increasing its stock
prices, a well-setup GPL project creates interest in fostering its
popularity and technological sophistication for all its
contributors.</p>
<p>Just imagine the over-poweredness of a GPL for music. The virality
effect of sucking all musical primitive inventions into a global
repertoire of sounds and samples.</p>
<p>But back to software and since, e.g., GNU/linux&apos;s repository has
accumulated years of work from a maximally diverse set of agents, all
licensing their work under GPL; it is maximally difficult to capture and
hence a direct threat (and blessing) to the world&apos;s most powerful
corporations like Google, Microsoft and others.</p>
<p>Sure, we could ask everybody who has ever contributed to Linux if
they&apos;d be interested in selling Linux for a bazillion dollars to
Microsoft: But the point is that reaching a sale-positive state in this
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/19/bullveto.html">vetocracy</a>
of GPL contributors would literally be impossible.</p>
<p>OSS is speech, and speech doesn&apos;t have a price. For artists, like
musicians, whose work is also often speech, their work too - should have
no price - and they should be paid like software engineers. So we should
work towards making that happen.</p>

<p>Vince from the AI Alignment and Rationality meetup in Berlin made me
aware of an interview of Lex Friedman with John Carmack where they end
up mentioning the same phenomenon too. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LddnZjkpflldHXnRZ0rrw?si=8uvXpi-JQliCCawSCjQONg&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;t=7457">Timestamped-link
