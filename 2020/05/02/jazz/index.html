  <div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The week before the first of May, I drove home to visit the family.
After all, we had planned to go skiing when the virus hit my region of
origin quite harshly. Additionally, my grandparents weren&apos;t doing all
that well, so there was no consensus in the family on what to do
genuinely.</p>
<p>I stayed in Berlin. At least half of my friends drove southwards to
their families. And then in the south, I have no idea what people did.
But naively judging by the numbers, Berliner&apos;s (at least in March) were
less naughty and paid close attention to their central coordinator (the
German government, the WHO?).</p>
<p>And then the second half of March and first of April were really just
the weirdest moments of my life. Suddenly, there was actual social
distancing and not physical distancing. It seemed that not only I but
everyone was struggling one way or another. I felt mistrust building,
especially since proper video calling simply didn&apos;t work well, but also
since nobody was supposed to go out and have a healthy life. My natural
paranoia gave it the rest.</p>
<p>But I think the weirdest part in all of this story played the city of
Berlin. Why? Because it seemed that people genuinely didn&apos;t give a shit
about the virus, but at the same time, everything worked so smoothly. I
mean, nothing had changed in the city. People went to parks, had their
coffee. Some even still went to work. Already in &quot;the outbreak&apos;s&quot; first
week, lots of shops had completely turned around their money-making
procedures. Instead of having to enter a cafe, now you had to scream
&quot;due Cappuccini&quot; through a street-level window. The barista, a weird
looking hipster guy, would then in safe proximity brew your drink while
suddenly you were able to pay cashless.</p>
<p>Yes, you heard that right. You were able to pay cashless. In Berlin.
But not only that. Additionally, the guy had set up a considerable area
of very spacious benches outside. That meant keeping a safe distance
while slurping Cappuccini was quickly possible.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, this early model of successful adaption quickly spread. My
local baker soon had introduced spacious queues and even a pipeline
system to handle customers. So while they had two entrances and exits
before the crisis, they suddenly had one deliberate entry and one door.
Eventually, they went further by introducing a cashier person (handling
all the money) and a bread person (packing the bread).</p>
<p>The shop next to the baker did another cool thing. They gave a 25%
discount on cashless payments. Not sure they still do it, but I found it
a nice touch.</p>
<p>Many other things happened too. I could go on. However, eventually, I
wanted to see my family, and so I rented a car and drove down south (I
used to take the train). And I can tell you, it was great! Not having
seen my brother, mom, and dad since Christmas, lots of information had
to be replicated. Lots of stories hat to be synchronized. Tears,
laughter, hope, despair. For sure, we had it all! And eventually, we
phased.</p>
<p>In fact, there was one particular moment that really got me phased
(or amazed?) very much. I guess I&apos;m telling the story on the about page
of this blog post too. Anyways, I&apos;ve been practicing playing the piano
for more than two years now. Initially, however, I had been inspired by
my brother&apos;s sick e-guitar skills. In a nutshell, the two of us had been
competing on playing instruments for a while now. Mainly on the piano,
when suddenly I realized he had brought his e-guitar this time.</p>
<p>We plugged it in on our parent&apos;s patio, and I hit a few notes. Then -
he had found the old western guitar from my mom - he played a few notes.
Suddenly the piano music theory lessons about harmony and melody started
kicking in, and I went into improvisation-mode trying to support and/or
lead what the two of us were playing. It was a fantastic feeling! Truly
a level-up in life. Jazz or multiplayer improvisation had always
fascinated me. It had fascinated me with a profound intolerance and
frustration of not being able to understand how it worked. But now,
since all I had to do was either, hitting low notes when he was playing
high notes, or high notes when he was playing low notes, it suddenly
made sense to me. And not only that. The next days, it also made me
think quite a lot about eventual consistency in distributed systems.</p>
<p>You see. These days all we seem to want is central coordinators with
god views guiding us. We deliberately trust them with our lives and
property. We do it because of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>.
Or because our collective intuition tells us to throw our dearest values
into the flaming pit, faithfully-believing that from the nutritious
ashes, a tiny new bud of hope will eventually appear.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not sure what it was this time we threw. Some argue privacy,
others say it was our freedom to freely travel the globe. In fact, I
think that on a global level, consistency hasn&apos;t emerged yet. It may be
that it will not for many years or decades. After all, there&apos;s money to
be made with this asynchronicity.</p>
<p>Also, I don&apos;t know much about these things, and so probably I should
stay within the realm of my domain to make arguments. And so let&apos;s get
back to Jazz. Well, actually, let&apos;s get back to uhm Cloudcountry and
distributed systems.</p>
<p>A story that I found quite inspiring in all of this is the story of
the creation of Lil Nas X&apos;s Old time road. Here&apos;s the video:</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sq6zmzE8y3U" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>To me, that video is incredible. It&apos;s incredible because it tells the
story of two entirely socially and physically separate musicians
collaborating. Even more so as they do it asynchronously, on an idea&apos;s
output that eventually requires total synchronicity (or strong
consistency). I mean, watch the video. The story has already been told.
YoungKio and Lil Nax X jazzed across a massive pond of water. They were
able to simply create the mega-hit of 2019 (and a weird genre too).</p>
<p>I&apos;m fascinated as in my naive understanding of music, I always
thought that Jazz meant breaking the rules of social and physical
distancing. I thought it meant getting together physically as bandwidth
and latency of the internet didn&apos;t allow musical cooperation. I felt
that through live streaming, we&apos;d never be able to indeed compose
collaboratively. But I was wrong. It&apos;s not better live streams or
telephony or central coordinators that we need for music to truly
succeed in times of SARS-CoV-2. What we need today is asynchronous Jazz,
or as we computer scientists call it: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> (and CRDTs), but for musicians! I&apos;d
call it an (.arc(hive)) or <code>.hive</code> :)</p>
