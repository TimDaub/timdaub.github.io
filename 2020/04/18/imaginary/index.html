called <em>&quot;The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage&quot;</em>. It&apos;s
about the invention of the first computer, the so called <em>analytical
engine</em>. It starts by telling the story of Ada Lovelace&apos;s coming of
age. And, in particular, about her being deliberately pushed into
mathematics and kept away from fulfilling any kind of creative purpose.
That, of course, doesn&apos;t go well for too long, before Ada starts
learning about &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers. A concept, so seemingly close to
poetry (and madness), her mother becoming worried that Ada could become
like her father. A mad polyamorous poet?</p>
<p>Anyways, apart from the stories about Ada and her companion Charles
Babbage, there&apos;s lots of mathematical concepts being nicely animated in
comic style. And so there&apos;s also this part where Ada&apos;s imagination quite
literally starts blossoming when she realizes that numbers do not only
exist on a single dimension. The book visualizes this really beautifully
by Ada literally walking along the scale of real numbers, soon realizing
that she can carefully climb up <em>imaginary</em> stairs. And so she
climbs carefully, but misses a stair at one point and falls &quot;back into
reality&quot;. Yup, I know, the book is pretty cool.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ada.png"></p>
<p>Sometimes I just wish, I had the imagination of Ada, when back in
college (or was it high school?), my teachers desperately tried to
explain me the concept of imaginary numbers. I mean, it was not that I
didn&apos;t want to understand, or that I was lazy or not interested. It was
just that this whole topic didn&apos;t make much sense to me. Why have
imaginary numbers when all you need in the world is real numbers. After
all, there&apos;s no imaginary sheep you could count, and no imaginary apples
you could add up. And so the concept of imaginary numbers actually never
stuck with me. Funnily enough, when we learned about vectors later, I
didn&apos;t have any troubles following along.</p>
<p>Maybe, it&apos;s that concept of telling a story, of opening up someone&apos;s
imagination that ultimately allows us to learn and be truly creative.
And with that, I&apos;d like to talk about <em>imaginary monies</em>.</p>
<p>See, in my view, the world today is quite behind its potential. When
it comes to money, at least. It&apos;s now been, what?, 50 years since the
advent of personal computers and 20 years since the mainstream adoption
of the world wide web? And still, we seem to transact like hundreds of
years ago.</p>
<p>But the world has changed. In fact, it changed already in the 70ies,
when we found ourselves at the advent of the <em>information age</em>
and the founding of the information society. You don&apos;t believe me? Well,
then get into this red-looking and playful-looking time machine below
and see for yourself!</p>
<div class="owl-media owl-video owl-youtube"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UiMus1FJb9w" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Isn&apos;t it beautiful? To me, at least, it&apos;s almost like time-traveling
and having a dialogue with the collective of humans that were
responsible for creating what we now call the internet. It&apos;s inspiring,
because these random strangers talk so clearly and freely about <em>our
world</em>. It&apos;s so frightening, because today, at least, I&apos;d argue,
we&apos;re often preceiving <em>their utopia</em> as <em>our
dystopia</em>.</p>
<p>That does tie nicely into the metaphor of Ada Lovelace climing
imaginary stairs. What would happend if she fell from high up back to
reality? How hard would the impact be? How long would she fall? Would
she bounce back up? Or only leave a hole in the ground? Hard to say, but
I&apos;d imagine the impact to be less severe than you&apos;d think. After all,
why should gravity only act in one dimension &#x1F60F;. And so that&apos;s why I
think we should start exploring radically new paths. Not paths,
dimensions. Dimensions of money. Imaginary monies.</p>
<p><em>Tim. Hold on. What the fuck are you talking about???</em> Okokok.
Hear me out! Just one, one last story and then you&apos;ll understand!</p>
<p>Sooo, in the early 2000s the www was really cool. And everybody
bought stocks and all nerds got rich and it was great. It was so great
that even traditional or established businesses wanted to go full
<em>cyber</em> by hosting their own websites. One of them was the New
York Times, an organization founded a staggering 150 years earlier.</p>
<p>Now, back in the days, publishing websites was quite difficult. There
were hardly any tools. I guess there weren&apos;t many developers neither.
But most probably, the bigest problem was that people were stuck in a
creative loop of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation">HyperNormalization</a>.
That is, they didn&apos;t know what to do with the internet. Maybe, they were
scared? And so in 1996 it happened that the New York Times simply
decided to scan their front page print and upload it daily as an image
on their website. They were so proud, they even published <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/22/business/the-new-york-times-introduces-a-web-site.html">an
article</a> about themselves, quoting a consultant saying: <em>&quot;The
market is booming for newspapers on the World Wide Web.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Little did they know... that you can&apos;t just scan your print edition
newspaper and upload a picture to your website, because, as McLuhan had
realized years before already: <em>&quot;The medium is the message.&quot;</em> And
hence, the closest resemblence to a truly cyberspacial newspaper may be
Twitter, Mastodon or Medium. Well, I guess that consultant was right
after all.</p>
<p>And that my friends, is the epic saga of Hypernormalizations being
born and dying, as they too, can be overcome with a simple trick of the
mind: Imagination.</p>
<p>Today, there&apos;s a particular topic that needs more imagination and
that is, as I&apos;ve already mentioned, the topic of money. Honestly, I
think, we&apos;d be fine in climbing the invisible stairs. We&apos;re collectively
and subliminally aware of transactional relationships and keeping
ledgers in our brain. David Graeber&apos;s 5000 Years of debt certainly is
proof enough of that. I don&apos;t think we&apos;d fall far, as in our deerest
need, there&apos;s many tricks and protocols in our cultures already.</p>
<p>So then, let&apos;s explore multi dimensional imaginary money and leave
these real and boring concepts behind! ERC20 tokens as reputation on the
the Ethereum mainnet. Naaaah, that&apos;s so 2019. What we build is a
reputation token that, acts as a multiplier for our base supply of
money!</p>
<p>Quadratic voting and reputation schemes? Artificially limitted and
carefully distributed token supplies? Naaahh, instead, why don&apos;t we make
<em>political influence</em> quadratically proportional to your actual
spending power? You know, making your reputation the base, and your
money the exponent.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s say we all agree to vote once in a big election. But then you
vote twice. Well, now you better have some stash saved under your
matress, because you&apos;ve significantly decreased your spending power but
increased your political reach.</p>
<p>I mean, just imagine the possibilities in cybespace, where the
relationship of monetary supply and political influence couldn&apos;t
possibly grow exponentially or lineraly. But instead, where we could
limit them through governance by adjusting <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.65952em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">i</span></span></span></span>, in:</p>

<p>I know, it sounds like a long shot now. But I truly think we&apos;re not
that far away from ideas like these being put into practical use. In
many ways, stable coins are a first step. So let&apos;s take another one!</p>
