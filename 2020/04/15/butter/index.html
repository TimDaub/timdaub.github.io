    <p>You all love margarine, right? It&#x2019;s the plant-based version of butter. Actually,
I learned about margarine the first time when I was in high school.</p>
<p>In economics class, our teacher tried to explain to us the concept of
substitution goods and so he made an example and said: &quot;A substitute good is a
good that can be used in place of another.&quot;<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup> Then he
continued: &#x201C;Butter and margarine are commonly referred to as substitution
goods. In the kitchen, they can be used almost interchangeably. If one day, you
go grocery shopping and can&#x2019;t find butter, it&#x2019;s likely not a problem as you&#x2019;ll
survive the week without major hiccups on margarine too&#x201D;.</p>
<p>And then, he took the chalk and drew a weird graph on to the board that
probably nobody in the room fully understood.</p>
<p>That was roughly 12 years ago. And since then, I thought about substitution
goods quite a few times. It was the usual subjects. Coca-Cola and Pepsi,
McDonald&#x2019;s, and BurgerKing. Taking a train vs. buying a car.</p>
<p>But then today, I had to explain a friend of mine the concept of a substitution
good, and I intuitively used the example of my teacher: Butter and margarine.
But as soon as the words left my mouth, I thought to myself: Poor cows!</p>
<p>OK, OK. Let&#x2019;s rewind a bit. Also, let me give some context.</p>
<p>First off, I live in Berlin. And everyone here wants to save the world. With
the purest intention. So even though you won&#x2019;t notice it much visiting the
city, my peers are incredibly political. But not the standard &#x201C;political&#x201D; YUPPIE
you&#x2019;re thinking. The Berlin youth <em>lives</em> their lives according to strict
principles.  To the uttermost extend. Quite often, even so much that it
burdens friendships. Especially, when you&#x2019;re a vegetarian-diet-red-pill-immune
person like I am<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Anyways, beginning last year, I started noticing a trend in how my flatmates
and I feed ourselves. Mainly because this big sausage company, called
&#x201C;R&#xFC;genwalder M&#xFC;hle,&#x201D; had begun to expand their meat-free meat substitution
products immensely. My die-hard vegetarian flatmate one day came into the
kitchen and started a chorus of praise about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ruegenwalder.de/produkte/vegetarische-muehlen-cordon-bleu">R&#xFC;genwalder&#x2019;s vegetarian
Cordonbleus</a>.
Since each package comes with two, he threw them in a pan, and shortly we were
eating analog meat with analog cheese inside.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ruegenwalder.png" alt></p>
<p>And what can I say? I actually liked these more than I liked <em>real</em>
Cordonbleus. Simply because I&#x2019;ve always had this childhood trauma of eating an
animal. Even today, every time I bite into a piece of meat, I secretly hope its
taste won&#x2019;t connect much to how the animal smells. I don&#x2019;t know. To me, that&#x2019;s
just terrible as I grew up surrounded by animals in a small Swabian village. It
breaks my heart and also utterly disgusts me when my body tells me that what
I&#x2019;m eating had been alive just a while ago.</p>
<p>But with these Cordonbleus, things were much different<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>!  I felt like I could really binge on those things. No
harm is done to animals! I technically can just eat 17 of them today without
feeling bad! Also, they taste so great with Sriracha sauce. It was just too
good to be true!</p>
<p>And so I lived happily, binging on all the great R&#xFC;genwalder Cordonbleus until
today when I had to explain this damn concept of a substitution good to a
friend of mine.</p>
<p>See, in my opinion, we&#x2019;ve enslaved animals within our capitalistic system.
We&#x2019;re extracting goods from them without their consent and selling them on the
open market. Some policies regulate on how we should be treating animals and
gladly, there are BIO labels. I genuinely believe that things <em>are</em> objectively
getting &#x201C;better.&#x201D; By the numbers, at least.</p>
<p>What nobody really questions, however, is if the cow would revoke their consent
of giving milk if it could. Sadly, though, if you model the brain of the <em>Bos
Taurus Economicus</em>, the rational cow, I believe it wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily revoke
its consent immediately.</p>
<p>Why? Because it has been domesticated towards what it is today for hundreds, if
not thousands of years by humans. I&#x2019;m sure some of you have seen the Netflix
documentaries too. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/">Cowspiracy</a>.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netflix.com/Title/70100084">Milk</a>. There are so many of these now.
Likely and sadly, because cows are now also seen as a significant reason for
climate change. The point of them is that cows today are massively optimized
for giving milk and meat. They can barely live on their own. They require human
help to survive because we&#x2019;ve domesticated them for maximum profit.</p>
<p>OK. But what has all of this to do with butter and margarine?  Well, for that,
we need to enter Donna Haraway&#x2019;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/staying-with-the-trouble">&#x201C;Staying with the
Trouble.&#x201D;</a> In it, she
argues that humanity is currently finding itself in the Anthropocene, a
geological epoch that&#x2019;s dating from the commencement of significant human
impact on Earth&#x2019;s geology and ecosystems (I stole that 100% from Wikipedia
btw.). But she goes even further and argues that much of the biology and nature
that we experience today has very much been influenced by humanity&#x2019;s history.</p>
<p>She talks about how loving carrier pigeons may be the reason for the story of
Romeo and Juliet to exist. But not only that, but she also challenges us by
arguing that we humans have an individual responsibility to be <em>response-able</em>
towards the domestic animals our ancestors and we have &#x201C;co-created&#x201D;. She argues
for &#x201C;making kin, not babies.&#x201D; And in general, she argues from a
truly-inspiring and honest way of &quot;making kin in the Chthulucene.
Chthulucene, being her suggestion for naming Earth&#x2019;s next geological epoch.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, Donna Haraway argues for a strategy she calls
&#x201C;becoming-with.&#x201D; Essentially a practical way for all critters to live and die
on &quot;terra. I understand it as follows:</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve inherited this world. It&#x2019;s full of trouble, but that&#x2019;s OK. Because each and
every one of us has the individual capability to be response-able (to act on
our own responsibility). Some of us have quite huge response-ability.
Some of us have very small. And some are in-between. Note that she&#x2019;s not
particularly making response-ability a global task. Instead, she&#x2019;s
deliberately making it <em>sympoietic</em> (collectively-producing, decentral control)
and not <em>autopoietic</em> (self-producing, central control).</p>
<p>To me, that&#x2019;s beauty in its purest form. Why? Because it gives each and every
one of us quite concrete guidelines on how we should act towards enslaved and
domesticated animals. We should behave towards them in our personal, most
morally-sound way. Maybe, today it just means petting a dog or not eating that
burger. Well, tomorrow, it can mean feeding thousands of pigs and not having them
slaughtered by an insane monopolized industry.</p>
<p>OK. But should I buy butter or margarine now???  Well, I think that&#x2019;s a
decision entirely up to you! I&#x2019;d still like to make a point about substitution
goods that I hope vegetarians and vegans may appreciate. It&#x2019;s indeed coming
from my heart and with no ill intentions in mind. Also, a disclaimer. I haven&#x2019;t
really researched this whole point, so while it may be rhetorically correct,
factually, it may not. But maybe it&#x2019;s also up to the readers to verify and
conduct studies! My idea with this essay is less to convince you about e.g.,
buying butter over margarine, and more about the way we can think about today&#x2019;s
problems from an ethical and also economical point of view. So here we go:</p>
<p>Butter and margarine are substitution goods, meaning they&#x2019;re technically
interchangeable in the kitchen. Butter is made from cows&#x2019; milk. Margarine is
purely plant-based. As cows have to be fed with plants, but since plants only
require water and sun, we can simply assume that for the purpose of a
cooking-fat, margarine is more efficient to produce and hence over a long
period a cheap alternative to butter.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/substitute.jpg" alt></p>
<p>Assuming you, e.g., increased the price of butter to improve the living
conditions of a cow, it&#x2019;d mean that you&#x2019;d decrease butter&#x2019;s demand, and at the
same time, you&#x2019;d increase margarine&#x2019;s demand and hence its price. At least in
the short term, it could be argued that given the market&#x2019;s structure, vegetarian
substitute goods are not contributing towards less animal suffering. Instead,
the opposite may be right.</p>
<p>Of course, this becomes even more problematic, the more industry processes and
products are replacing animal-based ingredients with plant-based alternatives.
Not only are plant-based substitutes structurally cheaper to produce as you
simply don&#x2019;t have to feed animals with plants to create them.  But
additionally, given the fact that you&#x2019;re taking money away, that is paying,
e.g., &#x201C;a cow&#x2019;s rent,&#x201D; you&#x2019;re also contributing towards more efficiently
extracting value from animals and hence to more extreme animal suffering.</p>
<p>In simpler terms: The fewer money farmers have to feed and maintain their life
stock, the more they&#x2019;ll have the incentive to squeeze out every last penny.
And judging by my intuition, that will undoubtedly mean more suffering for the
animal.</p>
<p>Oh jeez&#x2026;</p>
<p>Yeah, I know! The situation looks quite dire.  Well, yes, it does. But also it
doesn&#x2019;t. Because we&#x2019;ve just looked at cows as rational actors and we&#x2019;ve also
learned what it means to be a good companion species towards cows. We have to
become-with with them and act response-able!</p>
<p>So instead of calling on our politicians to create more rules and complexity,
I&#x2019;d like to encourage you today to think like a genuine capitalist. Assuming
that we want to move the world over to vegetarianism or veganism. Considering
that we want to optimize for as little animal slavery and suffering: What are
economic policies that could help cows, pigs, and chickens to live and die
peacefully during this phase of <em>aninomic</em> (animal + economic) turmoil? What can
help in the long-term? What&#x2019;s a solution that could be applied today? Think, discuss,
write!</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s my take on one idea:</p>
<p>Venture capitalists always talk about Universal Basic Income for their sacred
entrepreneurs. Well, why can&#x2019;t we have one for cows??? For example, couldn&#x2019;t we
simply have a tax on e.g., eggplants that would contribute towards CUBI (cow
universal basic income)? Mainly, it&#x2019;d be a policy, financing the board and
lodge of &#x201C;unemployed&#x201D; cows all over the world. What&#x2019;s stopping us from doing
that? I&#x2019;d pay for it. Would you?</p>
<p>Also, what policies would you like to create?</p>

<p><small><a name="f2">2</a>: By the way, I want to be vegetarian, but so far, I&#x2019;ve

<p><small><a name="f3">3</a>: Take this section with a grain of salt.
R&#xFC;genwalder&#x2019;s Cordonbleus today are only vegetarian.  This means some animal
abuse may take place. I&#x2019;d argue that today you cannot yet consume R&#xFC;genwalder
Cordonbleus entirely without guilt.<a href="#a3">&#x2191;</a></small></p>

Upon noticing, I\'ve contacted Substack and asked them to remove the\n\'SUBSTACK IS HIRING\' ad (Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/ZEaGFeI). Sadly, the company\'s representative recommended I remove the embed altogether.\nHowever, since I was too lazy to find a new email syndication service quickly, I\'ve now left the Substack newsletter embed and added this message.\n\nBest,\nTim')"
