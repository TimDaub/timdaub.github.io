    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day, at a party, I ran into someone that introduced themselves as anaccountant. And immediately, I felt a little sympathy for this person despiteus being strangers.</p><p>I felt it because - although it may be a gross overgeneralization - I&#x2019;mfamiliar with a stereotypical accountant&#x2019;s value system and because to mybrain, it signals: &#x201C;Hey, that&#x2019;s a person valuing similar principles in theirprofessional life. You two will get along nicely!&#x201D;</p><p>See, I grew up in a simple family in the countryside. Sure, my parents taughtme to properly handle my weekly allocation of pocket money, and I was neversomeone who&#x2019;d splurge or go on shopping sprees.</p><p>Rather, on the contrary, making big purchases - to this day accompanies me witha strong feeling of guilt. And simply put, it could be the Swabian way ofdealing with finances and risk: You work and work to build your house - andideally, you never spend that money.</p><p>And yeah, in case you&#x2019;re slightly put off by the particular formulation above:It&#x2019;s because that sentence&#x2019;s structure is a Swabian proverb, and its originalis: &#x201C;Schaffe, schaffe, H&#xE4;usle baue,&#x201D; which quite literally translates into:&#x201C;Working, Working, House building.&#x201D;</p><p>But with changing my country boy status to &#x201C;degenerate city dweller&#x201D; in 2015,when I moved to the capital, Berlin, I was often confronted with my Swabianroots and the prejudice of being greedy.</p><p>But with great confidence, and after living here for seven years now, I can saythat I&#x2019;m not greedy. I&#x2019;d say that I&#x2019;m highly conservative on spending money,and I&#x2019;m particularly frugal. But not greedy.</p><p>For example, despite &#x201C;being in crypto,&#x201D; you&#x2019;d be surprised how few riskyinvestments I&#x2019;ve ever taken. And even to my face, I&#x2019;ve been called out asparticularly risk-averse, and some even found it difficult to deal with me.They wanted to take on more risk, and I got cold feet.</p><p>As the frugality of Swabians seemed central to my origin, I&#x2019;ve beensoul-searching the topic too.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve read Daniel Kahnemann&#x2019;s &#x201C;Thinking fast and slow,&#x201D; and I&#x2019;ve managed tograsp &#x201C;Prospect Theory&#x201D; (which states that humans prefer avoiding losses morethan they want to acquire gains.) That resonated with me deeply.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve also liked the book&#x2019;s idea of separating emotion from rationality and thatit discusses an individuum&#x2019;s internal decision-making and splits it into twosystems: The fast thinker and the slow mediator.</p><p>Years ago, I ordered and read yet another rather particular book on moneymanagement titled &#x201C;The Richest Man in Babylon,&#x201D; and it also confirmed andtaught me a few other lessons on how to better deal with finance.</p><p>But truly, when dealing with money - I felt there was always this blind spothaunting me. It was that as soon as money was the conversation&#x2019;s topic, Istarted acting emotionally.</p><p>Before all of my time in crypto, and when I was just a student trying to earn afew Bitcoins on <a href="http://bitcointalk.org">bitcointalk.org</a>, it surprised me how intensely manipulative itfelt to own a small amount of stock in the market for the first time.</p><p>I must have had maybe 600&#x20AC; in Bitcoins, &#x201C;a few&#x201D; at the time: But nothing that&#x2019;deven closely put my student existence at risk. And still, there I was in myapartment, having the worst days when the price crashed.</p><p>I realize it is now the truth of what Warren Buffet teaches when he says thattemperament and investing don&#x2019;t go well together. That it is vital to separatethe body&#x2019;s desire to freak out and be anxious from the boring and rational taskof counting numbers - of &#x201C;accounting.&#x201D; My accountants told me many times.</p><p>That, my friends, is a lesson that made me like accountants.</p><p>In fact, just taking some time to lay down numbers in a spreadsheet, thepractice of periodically updating those: Emancipating yourself from marketswings and the anxiety of lacking overview. The calm of knowing to have controland not to be subjected to the broader public&#x2019;s mania or hysteria. And to neversplit the pie before baking it. That&#x2019;s what I learned from them, and that&#x2019;swhat I like about them.</p>]]></content>

And before we get into themeat, please let us prefix the article by stating that we, too, are &#x201C;beginners&#x201D;in this recently emergent field. But we&#x2019;re narrowly focused on delivering astandard, so we believe we have a position and voice worth hearing in thediscussion.</p><p>We think a good primitive design intends to do one specific task in a preciselydefined and highly reliable fashion - this is one of the first principleapproaches we took with ABTs, i.e., how do we best bind tokens to accounts withconsideration of consent and recoverability in mind.</p><h2 id="Misconception-1-EIP-4973-ABTs-do-discourage-key-rotation">Misconception #1: EIP-4973 ABTs do discourage key rotation</h2><div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1530845615030251520"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>The most common concern we&#x2019;ve heard when introducing the concept of bindingtokens to an account is that it discourages users from frequently rotatingkeys. However, given the standard&#x2019;s current state and that revocation orrevocation and re-assignment are a possibility, the standard itself makes nonormative statements about an ABT being permanently bound to an account - evenin case of key loss.</p><p>Quite the opposite, while <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>ABTs do indeed not implement<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">EIP-721</a>&#x2019;s <code>transfer</code> and<code>transferFrom</code> functions, it&#x2019;s intentionally designed to leave theresponsibility of re-assignment and revocation up to the implementer, i.e., acommunity, a protocol, a dApp, and not impose this as part of the primitiveitself.</p><p>But additionally, in the next paragraphs, we detail how Account-bound tokenscan further encourage key rotation and even help improve the <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">socialrecovery</a> of wallets.It&#x2019;s because Account-bound tokens are really just the primitive to build socialwallets and so we can frame <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>as a new token standard that introduces a non-normative and freelyimplementable transfer functionality using attestations and revocations.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s a lot to unpack, so we&#x2019;ll do it separately in the followingsections.</p><h3 id="Preventative-key-rotation">Preventative key rotation</h3><p>As the probability of a key&#x2019;s leak increases over time, preventative keyrotation is an established industry best practice. Users following suchpractice hence retire old keys for newly created ones to minimize theirexposure to attacks. A common concern about account-bound tokens is that theydirectly bind assets to a user&#x2019;s account (and hence their private key).</p><p>The argument is that when assets are inseparably-bound to an account, a user isdiscouraged from rotating their keys frequently as it&#x2019;d require a lot of effortto revoke and re-assign their credentials to a new account.</p><p>And while this argument can easily be made theoretically, in practice, we&#x2019;d liketo argue that it has to be made on a case-to-case basis.</p><p>For example, in the case of a university binding a credential to a student&#x2019;saccount, we&#x2019;d assume the university would give the student the ability torevoke and re-assign their credentials to a new account at any time.</p><p>Indeed, depending on the university&#x2019;s ABT revocation and re-assignment process,that&#x2019;d discourage (very tedious process) or encourage (very lightweight) keyrotation.</p><p>To encourage preventative key rotation best practices, we think ABT issuersshould carefully design their re-assignment processes. We believe that users ofsuch services will eventually flock to those that implement the most fittingmodels. But we don&#x2019;t believe there to be a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><h3 id="Dealing-with-publicly-leaked-keys">Dealing with publicly leaked keys</h3><p>Secondly, it&#x2019;s worth highlighting what happens to Account-bound tokens in thecase of a private key leaking e.g. publicly. Assuming the key-possessingattacker can front-run any on-chain interaction, e.g., they could call<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>&#x2019;s <code>function burn(uint256 _tokenId)</code> to non-consensually revoke the user&#x2019;s credentials. However, contraryto e.g. ERC20 or ERC721 tokens, an attacker wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily be able tosteal an account&#x2019;s credentials as there&#x2019;s no permissionless tranfer functionexposed.</p><p>But again, it depends on the specifics. If, e.g., ABTs are used by anundercollateralized loan platform to determine the user&#x2019;s credit worthiness,then yes, the attacker may be able to take out a loan under false premises.</p><p>However, having ABT-issuing institutions control the revocation andre-assignment process may be beneficiary in case of leaked keys too.</p><p>A university, being asked to re-assign ABTs to a new account, may ask thestudent for identity verification (e.g. a video call). So while an attacker maystill be able to front-run all of the user&#x2019;s on-chain interactions, depending onthe ABT-issuer&#x2019;s re-assignment process, they&#x2019;re not capable of passing theiridentification process&#x2019;s threshold.</p><p>Finally, in a high-trust environment, e.g., when Account-bound tokens are usedto represent the owners of a Gnosis Safe, in case of a private key leak, theclumsy user can talk to their peers off-channel to announce key leakage andhence initiate the social account replacement procedure of the multi-signaturewallet.</p><h3 id="Enabling-new-use-cases">Enabling new use cases</h3><p>Finally, it&#x2019;s important to mention here: A consensus around account-binding oftokens can enable a complete re-thinking of the significance of accounts. Itmay just enable the opposite of what Verifiable Credential proponents often useas <strong>the</strong> argument <strong>against</strong> Soulbound tokens: It could make <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/#ethereum-accounts">Ethereum EOAaccounts</a> irrelevant.</p><p>Consider this: A Gnosis Safe multi-signature wallet that requires two-thirds(2/3) of their owners for any on-chain interaction makes the leakage of asingle key less risky in terms of losing assets than if those were stored onone person&#x2019;s EOA account.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because the Gnosis Safe is still fully functional with one compromisedkey, assuming the non-compromised owners can safely communicate about the nextsteps: revoking the publicly leaked key.</p><p>The goal of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> is togeneralize the credential a Gnosis Safe is currently &#x201C;issuing&#x201D; to owners into acanonical interface and on-chain primitive parsable by wallets and indexers.</p><p>So rather than discouraging frequent key rotation:<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> represents a reasonableshot at getting rid of the messy leakiness of accounts and key management byallowing technical innovation in the space of private and high-trust cryptodapps like the Gnosis Safe or the MolochDAO.</p><h2 id="False-expectation-2-EIP-4973-ABTs-cannot-be-misused">False expectation #2: EIP-4973 ABTs cannot be misused</h2><p>Yes, you&#x2019;re reading this correctly. We&#x2019;re not going to claim anything utopichere. While the scope of an <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1">Ethereum ImprovementProposal</a> is far-reaching and powerful,it&#x2019;s not magic, and it cannot prevent the myriad possibilities of misuse.Similarly, e.g., IEEE RFC authors can hardly prevent others from being mean orstraight up abusive using email or HTTPS.</p><p>But let us be clear: None of Ethereum&#x2019;s infrastructure or standards currentlyprevent misuse. If you want to dox someone&#x2019;s Ethereum account, there arealready many ways to do so. And controversially, there is not a single way todelete that data. But, this is a discussion entirely out of scope for defininga token standard interface for wallet implementers within the EIP process.</p><p>However, we do think it&#x2019;s necessary to address <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/self-sovereign-identity-primer.md#ten-principles">the concerns around consent,control, protection andself-sovereignty</a>.</p><h3 id="Right-to-Disassociate">Right to Disassociate</h3><p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> implements a <code>function burn(uint256 _tokenId)</code> and requires it to be callable at any time by an ABTowner to ensure their right to publicly disassociate (or in MolochDAO terms:&#x201C;ragequit&#x201D;) themselves from what has been issued towards their account.</p><p>However, we also want to be conscious that consent in a constellation betweenmore than two individuals may become more complex than always prioritizing asingle person&#x2019;s will. Paper contracts between e.g. three persons exist whereone person&#x2019;s consent withholding can block decision-making of the two otherpersons. So while it looks like the <code>function burn</code> enables consensualinteraction, that may only be true for a constellation of two persons - notmore.</p><h3 id="Right-to-Mint">Right to Mint</h3><p>Similarly, we, the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> authors,are aware of the problems that non-consensual minting can create. But using avariant of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712">EIP-712</a> structured datahashing and signing, we believe an optionally-implementable <code>function mintWithPermit</code> can be implemented to allow an ABT receiver to&#x201C;<a href="https://nftschool.dev/tutorial/lazy-minting/">lazy-mint</a>&#x201D; with an ABTissuer&#x2019;s signed permission. Particularly one of us, Raphael, with Violet&#x2019;s<a href="https://erc1238.notion.site/ERC1238-Approval-43b7967b27ff4119ab15b4279f0fa61c">ERC1238Approvalextension</a>,has been looking into this technical possibility.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll update this post in the future to reflect our progress.</p><h3 id="Finally-a-Word-about-Blockchains-Misuse-and-Laws">Finally, a Word about Blockchains, Misuse and Laws</h3><p>Yes, blockchains store data practically <strong>forever</strong> (but consider<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444">EIP-4444</a>). And there have beennumerous amazing philosophical takes on the subject matter too. The best, inour opinion, is Ribbonfarm&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/05/25/blockchains-never-forget/">Blockchain&#x2019;s neverforget</a>&#x201D;article, which accepts blockchain&#x2019;s &#x201C;dystopian&#x201D; property of immutable,permanent data availability as a chance to rethink inter-human interaction.</p><p>Blockchains like Ethereum currently violate the EU&#x2019;s right to be forgotten. Ifuser data is stored on Ethereum by dapps, it may also violate the GDPR laws inmany cases. There is <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03513113/document">a debate about thealegality</a> ofblockchains. And similarly, we think there&#x2019;s acceptance needed towardsunderstanding blockchain as <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2022/02/28/smart-contracts-are-programmable-commons/">so culturally diverse andinternational/global</a>that, e.g., the EU or US&#x2019;s local laws won&#x2019;t &#x201C;just&#x201D; cut it.</p><p>It is not to say that we shouldn&#x2019;t use those laws as guiding principles forimplementing technology. But, clearly, in the case of bringing up the abusepotential of ABTs, the community should understand that any other tokenstandard or any other Ethereum transaction can also contain abusive informationlinking to accounts. It&#x2019;s a problem with Ethereum, not within specificstandards.</p><p>So generally, we want to encourage more discussion around the topic: But wealso want to be clear: This isn&#x2019;t a problem limited to ABTs. It is a problem ofblockchains and should hence also be discussed on that level.</p><p>ABTs can be misused, and we must work on heuristics to maximally preventmisuse. Within blockchains and generally for any modern and inter(net)-nationalpeer2peer protocol.</p><h2 id="Misconception-3-EIP-4973-ABTs-are-censorship-vulnerable">Misconception #3: EIP-4973 ABTs are censorship-vulnerable</h2><p>Then, once someone understands that ABTs can be re-issued using a sequentialrevocation and re-attestation, an accusation that has been brought up is thatABTs are vulnerable to censorship, namely because the implementer is in theposition to control the re-issuance.</p><p>And while, of course, this argument can be easily made, e.g., in the above caseof a university issuing credentials to students, what is vital to understand isthat the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> account-boundtoken standard makes no normative statement about the conceptual structure ofan ABT issuer or how they should do their job.</p><h3 id="Censorship-or-Moderation-Curation">Censorship or Moderation/Curation?</h3><p>A naive implementation of a university using<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> tokens may indeed bevulnerable to &#x201C;censorship.&#x201D; But that&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s implemented fragilely andwould require alleging bad intent. It also touches upon the question: Whatequates to &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; and what equates to &#x201C;moderation&#x201D;?</p><ul><li>Firstly, if e.g. a group wants to ban a person for misconduct and hence theydecide to not re-issue an ABT, that&#x2019;s their choice. It&#x2019;s not &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;because they don&#x2019;t carry mal-intent.</li><li>Secondly: If there&#x2019;d be structural, mal-intended censorship of a group overothers (read: discrimination): That&#x2019;d be bad and we should do anythingpossible to avoid it!</li></ul><p>But we, the authors, are discordant on how to deal with structural censorship.Some of us take the stance that technology must prevent harm. That&#x2019;s themainstream tech opinion where for example, social networks interfere actively.While others of us say that immutable blockchain-documented misbehavior isultimately a good thing for accountability and not technology must preventharm but the respective legitimate jurisdictional system of a user.</p><h3 id="Building-towards-Credible-Neutrality">Building towards Credible Neutrality</h3><p>The censorship-vulnerability argument against ABTs is one that assumes aworst-case scenario of mal-intended implementers. But the<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>&#x2019;s document now even makes anormative statement as a means to prevent mal-intended censorship:</p><blockquote><p>We recommend implementing strictly decentralized, permissionless andcensorship-resistant re-issuance processes.</p></blockquote><p>For making a visual example, let&#x2019;s imagine that a future decentralizeduniversity degree that may not come from the centralized credential emittingunit (with &#x201C;censorship capabilities&#x201D;) - but rather that it could be acollection of professors&#x2019; badges that the student earns through attendingclasses and being a bright apprentice.</p><p>ABTs do not mandate a token issuer to be a centrally controlled andcensorship-vulnerable entity, and so the argument that ABTs arecensorship-vulnerable likely stems from being misinformed.</p><p>We should implement ABTs issuers in a decentralized fashion. We should properlyrethink how our trust-crediting institutions work. We should fit them into themold of the interfaces we have available. And if they don&#x2019;t fit: Let&#x2019;s changeor add new interfaces.</p><h2 id="Misconception-4-EIP-4973-ABTs-are-an-example-of-a-Not-invented-here-Syndrome-Let&#x2019;s-please-use-Verifiable-Credentials-VCs">Misconception #4: EIP-4973 ABTs are an example of a Not-invented-here Syndrome: Let&#x2019;s please use Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</h2><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable credentials</a> are a goodstandard, and we believe there to be an intersection of utility between&#x201C;Soulbound tokens&#x201D; and VCs. But, we should acknowledge that both credentialsexisting off-chain and on-chain can be used by implementers.</p><p>However, claiming that something should generally be off-chain or on-chainwithout hearing the use case first is likely going to lead to an uninformedtake. Instead, we want to make clear that putting credentials on-chain isuseful too and that, additionally, it is not entirely correct to conflate ABTswith verified credentials.</p><p>While, yes, ABTs look like badges or credentials, and since today they&#x2019;ve beenframed as such many times, the<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>&#x2019;s author Tim Daubensch&#xFC;tzcame up with the standard <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2022/02/19/non-skeuomorphic-harberger-properties-erc721-nfts/">mainly to implement Harbergerproperty</a>.</p><p>The problem is that <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">EIP-721</a> and othertoken standards implicitly assume the ownership structures adhering tonormative private property laws. Tim has been blogging on the problems ofnormalizing those ownership properties before Weyl et al.&apos;s article - and howHarberger properties are inherently incompatible. The work on<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> goes beyond issuing badgeson Ethereum, and the <a href="https://partialcommonownership.com/">Partial Common Ownership workinggroup</a> has been discussing these issuessince ETHDenver at the beginning of the year.</p><p>So a direct motivating factor for publishing<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> was that it would allowusers to display an NFT-ish token in their wallet while giving walletimplementers the possibility to call<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165">EIP-165</a>&#x2019;s <code>supportsInterface</code> methodfor feature detection. In that sense, Account-bound tokens were meant as asimple backward-compatibility hack &#x201C;free-riding&#x201D; on any wallet implementing<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">EIP-721</a>.</p><p>So, strictly speaking, although we acknowledge the<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> standard to be useful forissuing credentials, it didn&#x2019;t even originate as a credential standard.</p><p>Then secondly, we think it&#x2019;s important to highlight why it may be useful to putbadges/credentials on-chain. See, someone issuing a token is required to send asigned message to Ethereum, and its consensus mechanism ensures the signatureand message&#x2019;s validity and integrity.</p><p>Additionally, messages sent to Ethereum are stored permanently for a rather&#x201C;negligible&#x201D; cost and without the need to run a server. That can have benefitsover storing credentials off-chain in some cases. In a post titled &#x201C;<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html">Where touse a blockchain in non-financialapplications?</a>&#x201D;, VitalikButerin makes the case why storing some credentials off-chain seems useful.</p><p>Also, by defining a standard interface for Solidity - which essentially<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> does, it allows ABTs toshow up in a wallet next to other tokens. So we&#x2019;re tapping into existing andpowerful infrastructure. Infrastructure that we&#x2019;ve collectively built withusers over the years in, e.g. teaching them how to properly back up a wallet&#x2019;ssecret phrases and so on.</p><p>Blockchain users have tons of collective experience keeping their keys safe -albeit the media&#x2019;s focus on portraiting key loss and leakage stories probablybeing structurally overempathized as drama receives more attention and clicks.</p><p>Finally, it&#x2019;s important to mention that we think Soulbound tokens,Account-bound tokens and Verifiable Credentials all have their individual merits.We want to encourage experimentation and we&#x2019;re open to discuss what trueinteroperability means (e.g. to non-Ethereum users).</p><p>Finally, a word on how we see Soulbound tokens being standardized.</p><h2 id="Misconception-5-EIP-4973-ABTs-is-the-best-standard-and-no-others-should-exist">Misconception #5: EIP-4973 ABTs is the best standard, and no others should exist</h2><p>Already within the working groups for<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>, we&#x2019;ve branched off andlistened to the community&#x2019;s feedback that is interested in, e.g., bindingcredentials to ENS names. As a result, we&#x2019;ve &#x201C;forked&#x201D;<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> to a new standard called<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5107">&#x201C;name-bound&#x201D; tokens</a> and submittedit as a draft PR to the ethereum/EIP repository.</p><p>Additionally, by intentionally binding tokens to accounts, we&#x2019;ve furthered thediscussion around whether that&#x2019;s a good idea. As a response, more generalizedapproaches like Micah Zoltu&#x2019;s<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5114">EIP-5114</a> are now being submittedtoo. It allows to bind ERC721s to ERC721s and hence doesn&#x2019;t have the supposedkey rotation issue.</p><p>We hope <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5107">EIP-5107</a>,<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5114">EIP-5114</a> and<a href="https://erc1238.notion.site/">EIP-1238</a> aren&#x2019;t the last attempts at definingSoulbound tokens for Ethereum. Rather, we think that for collectiveintelligence to emerge, although it often feels personal, many new ways ofexpressing credentials on-chain will be discovered to understand what userstruly want.</p><p>We must encourage other standards. Let&#x2019;s learn from each other to create adecentralized society and find web3&#x2019;s soul.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Please go ahead, screenshot that NFT - reupload it; hell, use the screenshot asyour Twitter PFP despite not having paid a single Wei for it! Yes, I don&#x2019;t care - It&#x2019;s because an NFT&#x2019;s image is METAdata. It&#x2019;s purely symbolical. Not acertificate of authenticity; it isn&#x2019;t the actual artwork either. It&#x2019;s just asymbol for a concept that has a price. Let me explain.</p><h2 id="Ceci-n&#x2019;est-pas-une-certificate-of-authenticity">Ceci n&#x2019;est pas une certificate of authenticity</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/a-pipe.jpg" alt></p><p>If you&#x2019;ve never seen Ren&#xE9; Magritte&#x2019;s iconic surrealist painting, I can&#x2019;t helpyou. My website isn&#x2019;t capable of transferring the actual image&#x2019;s atoms in frontof you. So yes, let me be annoyingly pedantic and remark: The picturedisplayed above, called &#x201C;The Treachery of Images&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t Magritte&#x2019;s piece.</p><p>Rather, it&#x2019;s a symbolic digital representation of his <em>real</em> work. Someone tooka photo of the original painting and so what you&#x2019;re seeing here is one of themany digital copies of Magritte&#x2019;s work. The real, physically painted canvas iscurrently on display in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>All of this to convey just that one aspect of Magritte&#x2019;s work: &#x201C;Ceci n&#x2019;est pasune pipe&#x201D;, meaning &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not a pipe.&#x201D; Because, the painting depicts <em>adrawing</em> of a pipe and not <em>just a pipe</em> - so really what&#x2019;s drawn on the canvasis a symbol.</p><p>While today, this being a rather obvious observation - in terms of correctlyidentifying concepts, I think Magritte&#x2019;s work is significant. It draws ustowards a certain confusion - we start conversing, discussing and learningwhat&#x2019;s real and what&#x2019;s &#x201C;just&#x201D; a symbol. What&#x2019;s particularly interesting for meis the pendanty this work emits.</p><p>At the risk of being taken for a trolling attempt, Magritte points out thenecessity to correctly identify things for what they are. I&#x2019;ve come across thisphenomenon so many times; and I&#x2019;d wish we&#x2019;d wake up to it more often. InKahneman&#x2019;s words, &#x201C;System 1&#x201D; is rushing to false conclusions, when we shouldengage number 2 - think slowly.</p><p>So then what are NFTs?</p><h2 id="NFTs-are-symbols">NFTs are symbols.</h2><p>There are two reasons, I&#x2019;ve started connecting symbolism to NFTs. It&#x2019;s becauseof two discussions that recently emerged in the field.</p><p>The first is <a href="https://otherinter.net/research/curating-value-exchange/">Hito Steyerl&#x2019;s interview with OtherInternet</a> where sherecaptures the ideas behind <a href="https://strikedao.com/">strikedao.com</a>, squattingBundeskunsthalle and <a href="/2022/03/27/the-user-experience-problems-of-quadratic-voting/">experimenting with quadraticvoting</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Sam Hart (SH): Squatting a name as a way to occupy the[Bundeskunsthalle] is something we want to ask about as well. Domainsquatting has been a practice for as long as there&#x2019;s been domain names, butthere&#x2019;s a particular significance to deliberately claiming their name? Whatpointed you in that direction?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Hito Steyerl (HS): Well, I mean, it&#x2019;s the whole NFT magic. It&#x2019;s laying claimto something. You don&#x2019;t exactly know what it&#x2019;s supposed to be, but it&#x2019;ssupposed to be very strong as a claim.</p></blockquote><p>The context here is that Hito Steyerl, in an attempt to squat the Germanexhibition hall Bundeskunsthalle, had symbolically bought&#x201C;bundeskunsthalle.eth&#x201D; as a claim to use it for running governance experiments;not to claim it as her property. Here&#x2019;s how she explains it:</p><blockquote><p>SH: what first motivated you to squat art institution ENS domains?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>HS: It was sort of a whim, I guess. I knew I had to do a talk at the RoyalCollege of Art in London, which at that point was in lockdown, but they stillhad a student strike at hand because the college was still trying to taketuition. There were no studio spaces or no activities to talk of, so therewas a student strike. Basically, I was trying to roll all of it into one byminting the whole institution as an NFT and giving it to the students inexchange for a larp, which they were supposed to create. Transforming it intoa worker, self-managed institution. That was the idea.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>HS: When I asked Mar&#xED;a Paula how to mint this most efficiently she said I shouldjust buy the domain because this would be formatted as an NFT anyway, but itwould also have the sort of squatting dimension, which I liked becausesquatting is also sort of devalidation of a property title. I mean, you&#x2019;renot claiming property of something, you&#x2019;re claiming usage of something. It&#x2019;snot occupying it in the sense that you claim it for yourself. Then, I startedminting some other ones at that time. I thought I will maybe use themsomeday.</p></blockquote><p>So she never intended to claim the Bundeskunsthalle as her property bysquatting &#x201C;bundeskunsthalle.eth&#x201D;: She used squatting the domain as a lever tomotivate a broader discussion about governance. Squatting symbolizing a claimof power.</p><p>It is interesting, this type of action in the context of NFTs because it attemptsto describe their utility. &#x201C;Laying claim to something [symbolically].&#x201D;</p><p>But it doesn&#x2019;t conclusivly answer the question what NFTs are. Really, are theysymbols? Or maybe certificates of authenticity?</p><h2 id="Are-NFTs-Certificates-of-Authenticity">Are NFTs Certificates of Authenticity?</h2><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9xdl9Gr_WA" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>On Wednesday last week, I was invited to a panel at NFTBerlin to talk about thehistory of NFTs and &#x201C;What we&#x2019;ve done.&#x201D; I&#x2019;m bringing it up here, as BeatrizHelena Ramoz, my co-panelist, from <a href="https://dada.nyc/home">dada.nyc</a> touchedupon some widely-contested definitions of NFTs.</p><p>On stage, we asked ourselves what NFTs are. Certificates of authenticity?Programmatic pointers to storage spaces in the EVM? Or do they represent theactual artwork?</p><p>Now, for the sake of fostering autodidacticism, I&#x2019;d now like to take the NFTscreenshotting meme ad absurdum for further seeking answers:</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oojg4PzNtyo" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Follow these four easy steps to get rich quick, anon:</p><ol><li>Go to your favorite stock training app, and pick your favorite stock. (e.g.AAPL)</li><li>Now, look for the image representing the stock.</li><li>Screenshot that stock&#x2019;s image</li><li>Profit! And since you didn&#x2019;t have to spend a single penny to own Apple -you, dear stranger from the interwebs, are a genius.</li></ol><p>So yes, here&#x2019;s my main point: NFTs aren&#x2019;t certificates of authenticity either.They&#x2019;re conceptual symbols and we&#x2019;re giving them a price on markets likeOpenSea.</p><p>In fact, lots of interactions on the computer are just symbolic - we probablydon&#x2019;t even notice anymore.</p><p>For example, when you &#x201C;like&#x201D; someone&#x2019;s photo of a cake on Instagram, you&#x2019;retapping the &#x201C;thumbs-up&#x201D; button. You&#x2019;re not directly communicating with anyonereally.</p><p>Instead, the Instagram user interface tells a server that they can nowbroadcast information to everybody else that you &#x201C;like&#x201D; an image. And really,it&#x2019;s all just symbolic that you&#x2019;ve instructed your computer to communicateinformation.</p><p>Sure, we&#x2019;ve become so comfortable with social media use that we think &#x201C;we&#x2019;recommunicating with others.&#x201D; But really, we&#x2019;re communicating with our computer,and then that computer communicates with other computers until a computer againcommunicates with a human and so on. By liking we&#x2019;re not &#x201C;saying&#x201D; (as in e.g.speaking/writing) anything online.</p><p>And so similarly, NFTs don&#x2019;t really represent an artist&#x2019;s artwork - even thoughan artist might explicitly want you to believe that.</p><p>In fact, if you dive all the way down the rabbit hole, you&#x2019;ll find that theoriginal NFT standard document, the <a href="http://EIP-721.md">EIP-721.md</a>, defines the NFT&#x2019;s image withinthe &#x201C;<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification">ERC721 <strong>Metadata</strong> JSONSchema</a>&#x201D;. So there youhave it. The image is merely &#x201C;metadata&#x201D;, not the actual entity (which is theNFT itself).</p><h2 id="NFTs-are-data-structures-or-financial-instruments">NFTs are data structures or financial instruments</h2><p>This leads us to conclude that essentially NFTs are nothing but on-chain datastructures allowing market-based price discovery. If you give them value in,e.g., Ether or USD, they become interest-bearing financial instruments. They&#x2019;requite similar to stocks or tokens.</p><p>NFTs aren&#x2019;t the artwork (in most cases); they may also not <em>represent</em> theartwork. And they&#x2019;re not certificates of authenticity.</p><p>Instead, NFTs symbolize what their issuer has done in the past, does today, andcould do tomorrow. They&#x2019;re non-fungible, interest-bearing financial instrumentsthat allow for both speculation (on the investor side) and conceptualliquidation of intellectual property to dollars (on the issuer side).</p><h2 id="Learn-more">Learn more</h2><p>Hito Steyerl&#x2019;s StrikeDAO project:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btQRji5fU_8">STUDIO BONN &#x2013; Exchange Values &#x2013;Krypto-Kapitalismus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3eLgH-Vm74">STUDIO BONN &#x2013; Who controls the Bundeskunsthalle?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Few people intuitively understand Copyleft. Especially in all peripheral partsof the software development industry, people are (painfully) unaware, but moreimportantly, I seldom see someone showing a deep understanding of Copyleft.</p><p>But Copyleft, despite many now disagreeing, makes the world go round. &#x201C;It eatsthe world,&#x201D; as a loaded baldheaded white man would say. So why is it that theideas of Copyleft and, more importantly, its sound understanding is lacking inso many knowledge-work-based and creative industries?</p><p>In the following article, I want to outline the importance of Copyleftlicensing in the software development industry. I&#x2019;ll purposefully conflate theideas of Copyleft licensing with other, higher-level, open-source softwareprinciples too. I&#x2019;ll do that intentionally to paint a decisive picture foreveryone working outside my industry, towards a better understanding ofCopyleft - e.g., in the music industry.</p><h2 id="Please-&#x201C;sample&#x201D;-my-code">Please &#x201C;sample&#x201D; my code!</h2><p>Contrary to, e.g. musicians, software developers happily upload theirpainstakingly-created code to public platforms. Consider this; softwaredevelopers are among the best-paid knowledge workers globally. In places likeSilicon Valley, they take home unheard-of paychecks and equity.</p><p>Still, if you know one, you&#x2019;re likely aware that on some Saturdays and Sundays,they&#x2019;ll cancel your brunch dates to instead sit in front of their computer justto fix this one bug in their open-source library.</p><p>If we were to put a nominal value on the amount of free work being pushedonline to GitHub; If we summed up all the accumulated hours of softwaredevelopers dwelling on code in their undies on the weekend - just to give itaway &#x201C;for free,&#x201D; every business person and their assistants would be losingtheir minds! It&#x2019;s anarchy! How can they do that?! Aren&#x2019;t they afraid of someonestealing their work??</p><p>But that&#x2019;s where I think it is important to understand that coming from anotherindustry, e.g., music, how software developers think when shipping open-sourcecode has to be considered vastly different from, e.g., musicians.</p><p>While Kanye et al. may go complete batshit about seeing their work sampledwithout prior legal agreement and moral attribution, as a software engineerworking under the principles of Copyleft, my highest goal is &#x201C;developing asample and then promoting it such that everyone uses it.&#x201D;</p><p>Software, being, fortunately, a rather recently developed art, gladly hadgenious contributors like Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, and others who madesure that attribution (git and package managers), licensing (e.g., GPL), andfree speech are built into the free (as in libre) software production stack.</p><p>In open-source software development, developers want their code to be &#x201C;sampled&#x201D;(or referenced) as broadly as possible. It furthers their brand andcredibility; it&#x2019;s their default as proper attribution is always given.</p><p>So it happens that when engineers write code &#x201C;for free&#x201D; and everyone uses it, arather direct incentive comes into play: they are invited to join higher-paidor higher-status jobs. They earn more money, are more popular, and sometimes,they even have to work less.</p><p>Open-source software developers like <a href="https://mxstbr.com/">mxstbr</a>, the creatorof the react boilerplate, have made a professional career out of a singlesignificant open source contribution. That guy wrote code that 1% of theworldwide web now uses, and he probably never made a penny <em>directly</em> from thatreact boilerplate OSS.</p><h2 id="Brand-building-and-Copyleft-are-better-than-Copyright">Brand-building and Copyleft are better than Copyright.</h2><p>Sure, particularly business types in the software industry may now say thatwith open source software, a company cannot sustain its business. They&#x2019;llenumerate countless examples where OSS hasn&#x2019;t worked out. Or, they&#x2019;ll list thenumerous instances where software is exclusively reserved under copyright lawsand generates shittons of cash.</p><p>And it&#x2019;s probably true: More money is directly made from exclusivelycopyrighted software.</p><p>But for me, as an individual, I have particular aims for my career, those beingthe freedom to explore my curiosity while still making a good salary - buildinga brand and contributing to the global catalog of OSS works well.</p><p>Moreover, I know for a fact, though, that there are many others like meprofiting from their work being openly accessible. After all, the world runs onopen-source software in 2022. There&#x2019;s no app, no website, phone, or car thatisn&#x2019;t using the undies-generated &#x201C;free&#x201D; code. As much as you cannot escapetechnology&#x2019;s accelerationism, for sure, you won&#x2019;t be able to run from having touse open-source software.</p><p>Today, writing open-source software and building an online brand is a well-paidand prosperous career any engineer should consider.</p><h2 id="OSS-is-speech-and-speech-doesn&#x2019;t-have-a-price">OSS is speech, and speech doesn&#x2019;t have a price.</h2><p>But developing open-source software goes far beyond just brand-building andmaking money as an individual. Albeit cynically (and falsely) derided,Stallman&#x2019;s Free Software Definition and its proclamation of software being&#x201C;free&#x201D; as in &#x201C;free speech&#x201D; (and not &#x201C;free&#x201D; as &#x201C;free of charge&#x201D;) is paramount tocreating a plane of freedom for all contributors.</p><p>It is here where I reference back to the article&#x2019;s beginning and when I saidthat few truly understand the power of Copyleft. On other occurrences when itwas clear, I&#x2019;ve tried to make a similar argument, e.g., when Facebook set outto build the metaverse, and <a href="/2021/11/03/principles-for-the-metaverse/">I said that a stock company isn&#x2019;t capable ofcreating a public good like themetaverse</a>. Only a FOSS approachcould achieve that.</p><p>Copyleft software licenses, particularly the GNU General Public License, allowsoftware developers to create a work, or a <a href="https://github.com/hintjens/socialarchitecture">socialarchitecture</a>, much greaterthan their individual contributions.</p><p>The GPL license allows each contributor to fully retain their Copyright whilemaking their work available under viral conditions. Any other user is permittedto use the GPL-licensed software in other GPL-licensed software, while thelicense specifically disallows distributing GPL-licensed code in proprietarilydistributed software.</p><p>The beauty of this construct is in viewing every single contribution of arepository as a GPL-licensed commitment from distinct individuals. It is thisviewpoint that makes clear the mandatoriness of GPL&#x2019;s virality and theincentives it creates.</p><p>A GPL contributor retains Copyright, and since their contribution can likewiseonly be used within GPL-licensed, an old code repository can grow into aconvoluted monster of individual code donations.</p><p>It is this property that makes contributing to knowledge work under Copyleft sopowerful. Because similarly to how an employee might work towards furtheringtheir company&#x2019;s interest in increasing its stock prices, a well-setup GPLproject creates interest in fostering its popularity and technologicalsophistication for all its contributors.</p><p>Just imagine the over-poweredness of a GPL for music. The virality effect ofsucking all musical primitive inventions into a global repertoire of sounds andsamples.</p><p>But back to software and since, e.g., GNU/linux&#x2019;s repository has accumulatedyears of work from a maximally diverse set of agents, all licensing their workunder GPL; it is maximally difficult to capture and hence a direct threat (andblessing) to the world&#x2019;s most powerful corporations like Google, Microsoft andothers.</p><p>Sure, we could ask everybody who has ever contributed to Linux if they&#x2019;d beinterested in selling Linux for a bazillion dollars to Microsoft: But the pointis that reaching a sale-positive state in this<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/19/bullveto.html">vetocracy</a> of GPLcontributors would literally be impossible.</p><p>OSS is speech, and speech doesn&#x2019;t have a price. For artists, like musicians,whose work is also often speech, their work too - should have no price - andthey should be paid like software engineers. So we should work towards makingthat happen.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In some of Daniel Kahnemann&#x2019;s books and any other business advice-typearticles, you always seem to read the same argument: The thing important peopleall over the world would like to see is increased risk-taking in the workplace.</p><p>And having spent roughly seven years in the startup space, I&#x2019;m starting toagree immensely with this sentiment. It&#x2019;s the unique Gen Z-er feeling ofboredom, flicking through startup ideas like your Tiktok feed only to realizethat 99% of it - you&#x2019;ve already seen it and that you&#x2019;re exhausted.</p><p>The craving for <em>true</em> originality, just a little hit of dopamine forexperiencing <em>the new</em>, it has become scarily real for me not only on socialmedia but also in the startup space.</p><p>So let me tell you in my real voice right now, &#x201C;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=citation&amp;book=Acts&amp;chapno=9&amp;startverse=18&amp;endverse=20">It fell like scales from myeyes</a>&#x201D;when I read Nick Tredennick&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amp/an-engineers-view-of-venture-capitalists-2650252508">Engineer&#x2019;s View of VentureCapitalists</a>&#x201D;article; from 2001 and saw him claim that &#x201C;VCs are sheep.

After all, in terms of thetype of investments, aren&#x2019;t VCs quasi <em>the</em> risk-takers that keep our economygoing?</p><h2 id="&#x201C;VCs-are-sheep-&#x201D;">&#x201C;VCs are sheep.&#x201D;</h2><p>But Nick&#x2019;s right. Particularly when focusing our attention on what really getsfunded and who are the new hot companies. Already the mainstream terminologymakes me wanna throw up: &#x201C;Unicorn!&#x201D; &#x1F92E;</p><p>Because, yes, after having hot meals delivered to your house and thatabsolutely <em>not</em> going great for years: Why not try now also to deliver coldfood (aka. groceries) too but under a different brand name and a slightlyadjusted business process.</p><p>And since this article is about keeping you engaged through quantitativeoriginality, just tangentially, maybe conspiracies are popular these daysbecause they&#x2019;re less boring than reality!</p><p>But yes, this is what it has come to: In Europe, the hot &#x201C;tech&#x201D; Unicorns are:&#x201C;Gorillaz,&#x201D; &#x201C;Flink,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Getir&#x201D; - all grocery delivery startups with exactlythe same market positioning and value proposition. They deliver food on bikes.</p><p>But not only does this situation confirm that VCs are indeed sheep, that theyall <em>baa</em> the minute one <em>baas</em> - it also shows the level of risk aversion theyexhibit.</p><p>Sure, here and there may be investors that fund radically new ideas, but isn&#x2019;tit interesting that the evolutionary output VCs are curating usually justbubbles up boring stuff?</p><h2 id="VCs-don&#x2019;t-take-enough-risks-And-neither-do-startup-founders">VCs don&#x2019;t take (enough) risks.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Harberger taxes, or &#x201C;partial common ownership&#x201D; as Eric Posner and Glen Weylcall it in &#x201C;Radical Markets,&#x201D; is an ideal business model for decentralizedautonomous organizations (short: DAO). As it connects a mandatory non-zeropercentage fee as a fundamental incentive mechanisms for truthfullyself-assessing property value a Harberger tax market:</p><ul><li>may provide a sustainable funding resource to the protocol developer; while</li><li>Incentivizing all &#x201C;partial common&#x201D; owners to truthfully self-assess propertyprices.</li></ul><p>Open source code and the possibility of forking a codebase made rentism bothhighly monopolistic and difficult to pull off for developers sustainably; Thereare countless sunset, market-broken products.</p><p>The Harberger tax creates a non-forkable &#x201C;necessary evil&#x201D; with the potential tofund future app or protocol development. And more: Harberger tax doesn&#x2019;t clashwith security laws (at least that&#x2019;s my non-lawyer opinion).</p><p>It almost seems too good to be true: but is Harberger tax really a DAO&#x2019;s idealbusiness model?</p><p>Before I dive in, however, if you want to educate yourself on Harberger taxesand partial common ownership, I recommend looking at <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/partial-common-ownership/">Radical Exchange&#x2019;sconceptpage</a>, as Iwon&#x2019;t go into explaining how it works.</p><h2 id="Harberger-Taxes-Aren&#x2019;t-Securities-I-think&#x2026;">Harberger Taxes Aren&#x2019;t Securities (I think&#x2026;).</h2><p>Hey, I&#x2019;m not a lawyer, of course. But Harberger taxes do not even closelyresemble tokens. Having spent some time <a href="https://github.com/rugpullindex/libharberger">coding them inSolidity</a>, I&#x2019;m confident insaying that tokens aren&#x2019;t necessarily required.</p><p>My personal story that got me into researching Harberger taxes in the firstplace was all the work I had done with<a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>, my side project.</p><p>As with Ocean Protocol, users started being able to upload and fractionalizetheir business&#x2019;s data using ERC20 tokens; I had the idea of building &#x201C;the S&amp;P500 for data sets&#x201D; (said project, Rug Pull Index). However, in a painful lessonmuch later, I learned that the legal landscape for launching tokens in Germanywas uncertain.</p><p>Sure, I could have launched in Singapore and all that jazz. But given that I&#x2019;dlike to fundamentally comply with the German laws and additionally, since Itruly believe in the possibility of launching a decentralized autonomousorganization through extralegal mechanisms - the thought of properlyincorporating always felt wrong.</p><p>I thought that if I &#x201C;dao,&#x201D; I wanna properly &#x201C;dao&#x201D; - ideally as a generalpartnership between contributors - or with as little institutionalized power asnecessary.</p><p>In a similar vein to the above story, to reach further independence from havingRug Pull Index funded through monthly OceanDAO grants proposals, naturally, Ionce played with the idea of launching RPI&#x2019;s database as a data token myself.Had it gone well, so I thought, I could use the token&#x2019;s price appreciation as afunding mechanism for future development.</p><p>But was I really going to risk my legal status to sell a mediocre dataset as afractionalized access token? Spoiler: I wasn&#x2019;t.</p><h2 id="Playing-Harberger-Games">Playing Harberger Games</h2><p>At first, the realization made me sad and I felt victimized: &#x201C;Why could I notsimply launch a token?&#x201D; But, realizing my unique position, I decided to keeppushing and eventually started to think of my token constraint as an edge.</p><p>My thinking is, that since I&#x2019;m putting myself out of the available comfortzone, necessarily my brain will eventually start developing ideas to solve theproblem.</p><p>However, throughout that process, I didn&#x2019;t only come to see that it was legallycumbersome launching an ERC20 token - I also realized that such a financialinstrument might not serve my project as the necessary vehicle for pushing itforward.</p><p>Instead, I learned that <a href="/2021/10/31/tokens-considered-harmful/">tokens might beharmful</a>, that<a href="/2021/12/15/token-holders-arent-slaying-moloch/">they don&#x2019;t automatically incentivize everyone to do the rightthing</a>,and that <a href="/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">being intrinsically motivated is more valuable than beingincentivized</a>.</p><p>Simultaneously, through <a href="/2022/03/27/the-user-experience-problems-of-quadratic-voting/">working onStrikeDAO</a>,I also became more interested in Weyl and Posner&#x2019;s work: &#x201C;Radical Markets&#x201D;; Igot re-introduced to Harberger taxes. And then it clicked.</p><h2 id="I-thought-Sustainable-Business-Models-in-Crypto-were-Impossible">I thought Sustainable Business Models in Crypto were Impossible</h2><p>See, I had always been fascinated with &#x201C;making it&#x201D; in crypto, given the uniquedynamics of the space.</p><p>Mixing money-making and open-source seemed fascinating; it <em>is</em> fascinatingbecause it combines the rigorous transparency of the open-source community withthe mandated scrutiny of public-facing financial institutions.</p><p>In 2018, when I, too, had been working on decorating the original OceanProtocol whitepaper, my biggest questions had been around the market&#x2019;ssustainability or, more generally, how any decentralized app was supposed tomake money.</p><p>At the time, it seemed an impossible proposition: Since crypto happened mostlyon an extralegal plane and since open source licensing wasn&#x2019;t even necessarilydefendable, e.g., when Sushiswap forked Uniswap, I thought that finding asustainable business model in crypto was a feat of impossibility.</p><p>My thinking had been that if any DAO would start inserting a fee into theircode, then logically, someone else could come along, fork the code base andcompete with the original&#x2019;s higher fee.</p><p>A few months ago, if you had asked me, I would have told you that there&#x2019;s(practically) no way someone could sustainably seek rent in open source or thecryptocurrency space.</p><h2 id="Harberger-Taxes-can-be-a-Sustainable-Crypto-Business-Model">Harberger Taxes can be a Sustainable Crypto Business Model.</h2><p>Today, better understanding Harberger taxation: I&#x2019;m reconsidering this view.</p><p>I think that if someone can find a property class subject to fundamentalmonopoly dynamics, a type of property with qualities as land on Earth displaysit. Then, if that individual can create a partial common ownership marketaround it, they will be able to reap the tax income&#x2019;s benefits to develop theprotocol further.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because, fundamentally, with Harberger taxes, we want the self-assessmenttax to be non-zero (to avoid property becoming private) but at the same timeoptimized for the right property turnover rate.</p><p>To create the desired positive externality for all market participants, aHarberger tax must both be non-zero but also not too expensive.</p><p>Contrary to taxing markets with non-mandatory fees (e.g. through naiverent-seeking), Harberger&#x2019;s tax is fundamentally an incentive mechanism - withthe actual income generated from the tax collection being technically a<em>by-product</em>.</p><p>Creating a Harberger tax property market is sustainable as competitive &#x201C;marketbreakers&#x201D; can&#x2019;t simply clone the product and lower the fees - the best turnoverrate producers and market maintainers in a partial common ownership world wouldfinancially outcompete copycats.</p><p>Harberger taxes, and in general, the proposals in Radical Markets are excitingnew ideas for <a href="2022/02/28/smart-contracts-are-programmable-commons/">the nutritious substrate that are smartcontracts</a>. I&#x2019;m excitedto see more of them in action!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In their seminal book, &#x201C;Radical Markets,&#x201D; Eric Posner and Glen Weyl introducequadratic voting to improve (or radicalize) democratic preference voting. Theyargue that by allowing voters to express preference intensity and introducing asocial cost for voters, the vote more accurately reflects the populous opinionon a set of choices.</p><p>On March 16, 2022, with Hito Steyerl, <a href="https://decentralala.com">DoD</a> and<a href="http://studiobonn.io">Studiobonn</a>, inspired by Weyl et al.&apos;s idea, weconducted a quadratic vote on the future governance mechanisms ofBundeskunsthalle, a federally-backed art exhibition hall. To allow audienceparticipation, we handcrafted <a href="https://strikedao.com">strikedao.com</a> (<a href="https://github.com/strikedao/strikedao.com">sourcecode</a>), a minimum viable quadraticvoting app. Livestream recording on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3eLgH-Vm74">YouTube</a>.</p><p>Having been the main developer behind the application, and since I&#x2019;m currentlystudying Weyl et al.&apos;s book, with this post, I&#x2019;ll name several conceptionaluser experience problems we ran into during implementation.</p><p>Before I dive in, however, if you want to educate yourself on quadratic voting,I recommend looking at RadicalExchange&#x2019;s concept page on <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/">quadraticvoting</a> as I won&#x2019;treally go into explaining how it works.</p><h2 id="Problem-1-A-Social-Cost-For-Voting-Isn&#x2019;t-Intuitive">Problem #1: A Social Cost For Voting Isn&#x2019;t Intuitive.</h2><p>In their 2018 book, Weyl et al. introduce the benefits of having a social costby telling the story of a town and its nearby power plant emitting pollutantsinto the air. Their argument: Depending on the individual&#x2019;s intensity ofpreference, a cost should incur for how much they each demand the plant&#x2019;spollution to decrease assuming everyone&#x2019;s electricity bills dropping.</p><p>For example, in a town with many pollution-tolerant citizens that prefer cheapenergy, Nils, who is running a laundry and is strongly anti-air pollution,shall bear the (quadratic) cost of change in relation to his peers. Saiddifferently, he should pay the nominal economic cost of his peers&#x2019; higherelectricity bill that would result from lowering the town&#x2019;s pollution.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/cost-of-externality.png" alt="A really sloppy drawing of the externality geometry of Nils. For a better one, buy Weyl&apos;s book."></p><p>While, actually, this example motivates the point for introducing a social costto preference voting well, I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s much harder to grok in real-life votingscenarios.</p><p>Not only isn&#x2019;t it always possible to directly identify a concrete economic costfor each proposal in a voting process, but also, if we&#x2019;d vote only on choiceswith perfect information, we may not have to vote in the first place. Thingswould just take care of themselves.</p><p>My point being that preference voting on choices isn&#x2019;t always easily reducableto a nominal economic problem. Particularly not these days.</p><h2 id="Learning-to-differentiate-between-&#x201C;voting-credits&#x201D;-and-&#x201C;votes&#x201D;-is-hard">Learning to differentiate between &#x201C;voting credits&#x201D; and &#x201C;votes&#x201D; is hard.</h2><p>However, here&#x2019;s where I see the first actual user experience problem withquadratic voting: Introducing &#x201C;voting credits&#x201D; and mapping them onto votesthrough a mathematical function is where we abandon many.</p><p>In my personal experience, asking people to &#x201C;forget&#x201D; all about voting and thenintroducing &#x201C;voting credits&#x201D; that only become votes after running them througha quadratic cost function $c(x) = {x}^2$ is a huge challenge. Honestly, andwithout wanting to sound rude, most people probably have long forgotten what aquadratic function looks like or that it&#x2019;s just a more elegant way of saying:We&#x2019;re going to square some numbers. Those school days have been a while back&#x2026;</p><p>But additionally, I want to stress the difficulty of motivating theintroduction of &#x201C;voting credits&#x201D; - which even I am having trouble understandingat times. The problem is only exemplified by the backwardness of math itself.</p><h2 id="The-Math-Of-Quadratic-Voting-is-Literally-Backward">The Math Of Quadratic Voting is Literally Backward</h2><p>As humans of the twenty-first century, we&#x2019;re well-versed in allocating budgetsand spending &#x201C;credits&#x201D; everywhere. E.g., if we have 5&#x20AC; in our wallets, we areeasily capable of spending them on one espresso, one cappuccino, and one pieceof cake - if all those end up costing roughly five euros.</p><p>But with quadratic voting, and since we&#x2019;re used to having natural numbers asvoting outcomes, the cost function is reversed. We don&#x2019;t define quadraticvoting as:</p><p>$$\sqrt{\text{number of voting credits}} = \text{number of votes}$$</p><p>but instead:</p><p>$$\text{number of voting credits} = {(\text{number of votes})}^2.$$</p><p>At least that&#x2019;s both what<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quadratic_voting&amp;oldid=1068861327">Wikipedia</a>and Weyl&#x2019;s book suggest. Where, e.g., five voting credits simply cannot beallocated as it&#x2019;d compute to be $\sqrt{5} = 2.23&#x2026;$ votes, a floating-pointnumber nobody wants to deal with<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>.</p><p>This subtle difference leads to a lot of confusion in the front end. It&#x2019;s, forexample, why some voters may not be able to allocate <strong>all</strong> their votingcredits. Below&#x2019;s why&#x2026;</p><h2 id="Voters-May-Not-Be-Able-to-Allocate-All-Their-Credits">Voters May Not Be Able to Allocate All Their Credits</h2><p>In our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3eLgH-Vm74">show with Studiobonn</a>, we,e.g., had given 25 voting credits to each participant and implemented theabove-outlined (&#x201C;backward&#x201D;) math. However, having three proposals gave rise tovoting configurations where voters could not spend all credits. An example ofthe interface is linked in the tweet below.</p><div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/timdaub/status/1504836460029034498"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>In our case, if a user allocated all credits to one proposal, the math workedout in their favor and they&#x2019;d vote with five. However, if they decided toallocate credits to other proposals partially, then sometimes they ended uphaving leftover credits they couldn&#x2019;t otherwise spend. Consider where, e.g., avoter allocates as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>proposal A</strong>: 3 votes (or $3^2 = 9 \text{ credits}$)</li><li><strong>proposal B</strong>: 3 votes (or $3^2 = 9 \text{ credits}$)</li><li><strong>proposal C</strong>: &#x2026;</li></ul><p>Now, inevitably since there are only seven more credits left ($25 \text{ total} - 9 - 9 = 7$),and since there&#x2019;s no natural number that can be squared toequate 7 ($\sqrt{7} = 2.65&#x2026;$), this voter won&#x2019;t be able to allocate all theircredits according to their intensity of preference.</p><p>If they decided to give four credits (or two votes) to proposal C, they&#x2019;d beleft with $25 - 9 - 9 - 4 = 3 \text{ credits}$. Similarly, if they wanted tospend nine credits (or three votes), they&#x2019;d run out of credits beforehand as $25 - 9 - 9 - 9 =-2 \text{ credits}$.</p><p>When working with users of StrikeDAO, I often noticed their confusion aroundthis problem. And while it makes sense thinking through it, it&#x2019;s a realhead-scratcher for user experience designers.</p><p>Moving on, &#x2026;</p><h2 id="Quadratic-Voting-Results-Are-Hard-To-Interpret">Quadratic Voting Results Are Hard To Interpret</h2><p>However, I think the probably <strong>best feature</strong> of boring democratic electionsis the replicability of a one-person one-vote election. If e.g., in Germany,all citizens go voting, we can roughly expect that the sum of all votes is 80million people - or whatever the latest census number from Wikipedia says.</p><p>It&#x2019;s this thing our math teachers tried to hammer into our brains before everyexam: Sanity-check your results. If the outcome is beyond stupid, trace backthe calculation path to find the error.</p><p>With regular voting, sanity checks are easy as most people are capable ofadding all proposal results. I mean, unless you vote for Trump - then all betsare off.</p><p>Still, with quadratic voting, this way of sanity-checking an election&#x2019;s resulthas suddenly become a non-trivial math challenge.</p><p>First of all, since the election&#x2019;s result is the sum of each voter&#x2019;s creditallocation ran through the square root, and since in additions with squareroots, the commutative rule is invalid $\sqrt{a + b} \neq \sqrt{a} +\sqrt{b}$, I can&#x2019;t find an easy way to interpret quadratic voting results.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/strikedao-voting-results.png" alt="A screenshot of StrikeDAO&apos;s voting results"></p><p>Albeit arguably our design and implementation failure in this regard, whatwould you conclude from the above screenshot? We can see that &#x201C;There&#x2019;s No SuchThing As Disintermediation&#x201D; came in first and &#x201C;Beyond Public Accountability&#x201D;second. And more?</p><p>In fact, at this point, I&#x2019;d even consider it a luxury to understand, e.g., &#x201C;howdifferent people voted&#x201D;: When I see that screenshot, my main question is: Didthe vote work out well?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum is a better publishing platform than any of its web2 counterparts.Like Facebook or Twitter.</p><p>It&#x2019;s globally distributed, has no geographical headquarters, and has nobody incharge. Ethereum won&#x2019;t delete, hide or algorithmically reshuffle posts. Itsnewsfeed is the block order, but it won&#x2019;t <em>block</em> certain politically-loadedtopics. Its operators&#x2019; incentive is making money through transaction inclusion,not running ads. Ethereum rejects the concept of content curation andmoderation.</p><p>Publishing on Ethereum is as close as it gets to shouting your words in the airwhen surrounded by others. Ethereum is the publishing platform we deserve.</p><h2 id="The-Tale-of-Three-Webs">The Tale of Three Webs</h2><p>There&#x2019;s the tale of the web&#x2019;s evolution among people in the industry. You&#x2019;veprobably heard it a million times by now, but how it goes is that web1 wasread-only, and web2 added publishing or &#x201C;write.&#x201D; With web3 emerging through theadvances of distributed systems, everyone has to have their opinion about it -<a href="/2020/09/08/web3/">me included</a>.</p><p>But Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Signal, published his &#x201C;<a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">(&#x2026;) firstimpressions of web3</a>&#x201D;at the beginning of this year and caught my attention. A central thesis of hispiece is that &#x201C;People don&#x2019;t want to run their own servers, and never will.&#x201D; Thestory he relays is that web2&#x2019;s platforms emerged to fill the web1 users&#x2019; desireto stop running their own infrastructure.</p><p>And to unpack that, I want to empathize with his viewpoint.</p><p>Running web servers in times of web1 was indeed truly cumbersome. There were nocloud providers; internet connections were shit, and web development tooling aswe know it wasn&#x2019;t existent. Moxie makes this argument as it fits his centralthesis that the &#x201C;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj3YFprqAr8">ecosystem ismoving</a>.&#x201D; He&#x2019;s saying: We&#x2019;realready upgrading the web with protocols that omit to collect (meta)data tosolve &#x201C;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Social_Dilemma&amp;oldid=1076198943">The SocialDilemma</a>.&#x201D;The product they publish, the Signal messenger, e.g., <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/">provided no meaningfuldata to the Central District ofCalifornia</a>, statingthat &#x201C;Signal still knows nothing about you, but inexplicably the governmentcontinues to ask [us].&#x201D;</p><p>So, by upgrading from web 2.0 to web 2.1, as Moxie suggests - can we pack upand move on from building cryptocurrencies? He solves the social dilemma? Isthat it?</p><h2 id="The-Public-Facing-Web2">The Public-Facing Web2</h2><p>The problem with Moxie&#x2019;s behavior and article is that he didn&#x2019;t stay in hislane. Signal isn&#x2019;t truly a &#x201C;web2 platform&#x201D;, in the sense of Facebook, Twitter,and Telegram.</p><p>Within a chat on Signal, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Twitter, or any otherinstant messenger, for that sake, nobody gets centrally moderated or shut down.I&#x2019;d assume you can speak freely in private conversations. The problem being inthat case, who else is reading the conversation? Talking to you, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/government-agent-watching-me">Mr. FBIAgent</a>. Here,privacy is at risk, and Signal&#x2019;s protocol is a brilliant fix.</p><p>However, I&#x2019;d like to argue that instant messaging (except for how Telegramimplements it) isn&#x2019;t really contested as a societal problem. The societalproblem that leads people to give conference talks, go on podcasts and writeblog posts is big tech&#x2019;s active curation of public discourse on newsfeeds. Casein point: &#x201C;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-facebook-instagram-temporarily-allow-calls-violence-against-russians-2022-03-10/">Facebook allows Ukraine war posts urging violence against invadingRussians</a>.&#x201D;</p><h2 id="Taking-On-Responsibility">Taking On Responsibility</h2><p>Hence, rhetorically scrutinizing once again Moxie&#x2019;s original thesis if &#x201C;Peopledon&#x2019;t want to run their own servers, and never will,&#x201D; I&#x2019;d like to assume thatin the general case: <strong>It&#x2019;s incorrect</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, would I, as a nerd, be asked to administrate a server running theSignal protocol for friends and myself: I&#x2019;d say &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; immediately. It&#x2019;sbecause: &#x201C;Signal still knows nothing about [us],&#x201D; and so it&#x2019;d seem unlikelyhaving to take on substantial responsibility. But Signal also doesn&#x2019;t host apublicly accessible digital room as, e.g., Telegram&#x2019;s channels or Facebook&#x2019;snewsfeed do.</p><p>Would I want to contribute to hosting the Facebook newsfeed, and for that sake:Would I want to take on responsibility for shaping public discourse?</p><p>Back in the old web1 days, people had guestbooks and comment sections on theirpages: Nowadays they don&#x2019;t - but it&#x2019;s not because nobody wants to host theirservers: It&#x2019;s because of the heavy responsibility of doing so. It must be thereason they say that &#x201C;<a href="https://mux.com/blog/you-either-die-an-mvp-or-live-long-enough-to-build-content-moderation/">you either die an MVP or live long enough to buildcontentmoderation</a>,&#x201D;and I believe that&#x2019;s true.</p><h2 id="Ethereum-is-the-newsfeed-we-deserve">Ethereum is the newsfeed we deserve</h2><p>And so that&#x2019;s why web3 is taking off. That&#x2019;s why it has fans and nodeoperators. Sure, it isn&#x2019;t very pleasant running an Ethereum full node andcurrently costs me roughly 130 EUR/month. But it guarantees that worldwide,whoever wants can publish whatever they want on-chain if they just pay thetransaction costs.</p><p>&#x201C;<a href="/2022/02/28/smart-contracts-are-programmable-commons/">Smart Contracts are the ProgrammableCommons</a>.&#x201D; Whiletraditional web2 platforms like Facebook are built on the assumptions ofprivately owned property and require taking on responsibility, Ethereum iscollectively maintained, hosted, administrated, and run by everyone.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no sorting for relevancy or increasing ad impression revenue. There&#x2019;sno moral or social dilemma stemming from having total control over others&#x2019;communication. Node operators may be biased, but &#x201C;Ethereum is neutral.&#x201D;</p><div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1496695587495981056"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>That&#x2019;s why Ethereum is the newsfeed we deserve.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#x2019;s smart contracts allow developers, for the first time in history, tobuild ownership experiences residing in the commons. Traditional cloudplatforms like Amazon&#x2019;s AWS or Microsoft&#x2019;s Azure are built on the assumption ofprivately owned property and hence also taking on responsibility and liabilityin computing. A rented server running a program orchestrated by an individualwill always necessitate seeking those to be held accountable.</p><p>Decentralized smart contracts, owned and controlled by no single natural orjuristic person, hosted by no particular individual, do not look or feel likeprivate property. They are collectively maintained, hosted, administrated, andrun; they ARE the commons.</p><p>Deploying a simple stateful contract on Ethereum that carries no codifiednotion of specifically-added ownership is not hosted by anyone in particular.Its deployment can be orchestrated such that no individual could be observed as&#x201C;the deployer.&#x201D; A contract&#x2019;s existence is solidified through its data&#x2019;s blockinclusion. Its data is continuously and neutrally made available as part of alldata being on-chain available. No one individual could be observed as theoperator or controller of such a contract.</p><p>A contract&#x2019;s execution is not directly controllable. Unless specified, itslifetime is not limited. A message call invokes a contract&#x2019;s public andexternal functions. Its computation is redundantly run by any individual blockproducer on the network. Not by some, but by anyone participating in thenetwork.</p><p>No individual block producer or full node executes the message call. Thoughtransactions are prioritized through payment, all nodes are obligated to returnthe one deterministic result. There is no one individual responsible, liable,or accountable for delivering on the call.</p><p>Ethereum&#x2019;s smart contracts are the programmable commons as they truly allowproperty to transcend into the common realm. Since smart contracts are, asoutlined above, an instrument residing in the commons, giving them ownershipover other property allows it to transcend into the commons too.</p><p>Properly configured common ownership contracts do not allow property escapinginto private possession either. Physical and commonly-owned property configuredthrough paper contracts, on the contrary, allow transcendence into the hands ofprivate owners.</p><p>Arguably, a stone on the bottom of the Atlantic ocean is commonly owned by allcreatures on earth capable or willing to exercise the common property concept.Similarly, in some countries, at least, so is water. This quality not onlyimplies shared responsibility for the objects in question, it also asks formutually-assumed liability. Indeed, shared property requires normativebehavior.</p><p>It means that no one single co-owner of a partially owned water source isentitled to make decisions. At the risk of polluting the water source, allinteractions with it require normative action, as the only acceptable behavioris one that can potentially become a mutually agreed-upon rule for all.</p><p>If they dare, the private owner, both legally and morally, is capable ofpolluting their possession: the water source. If they, through their will,decide to do it, and if it is their property, we have agreed to allow it underprivate property law.</p><p>It is important to realize how different common ownership experiences are andhow little practical governing experience we all have. It is also important tounderstand that the transcendence of property between the two realms is, asalready claimed prior, a possibility.</p><p>Nobody&#x2019;s stone can become someones. Moral, law, history, and recourse helpdefine over time who owns what. On Ethereum, that is similar but different.</p><p>Here, given its pristine unregulated nature, smart contract developers are notnecessarily bound to use the standard societal constructs of private property.As smart contracts themselves symbolize already an instrument in the realm ofthe commons, and since neither the legal system nor recourse is strictlyrequired or capable of governing possession, blockchain property may never bedirectly controllable, albeit logically still exist outside of a vacuum.</p><p>Besides private property, common property or new forms like Harberger property,code, similar to prose and imagination, can extend towards any shape or form ofnon-skeuomorphic property.</p><p>No matter the view of legal advisors on the subject matter and their desire toseek skeuomorphic comparisons for rational regulation: Today, with systems likeEthereum, completely new forms of digital (and atomic?) ownership experiencesare possible that will necessarily challenge the fundamental assumptions ofprice discovery, evaluation, supply and demand economics, and the legal system.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is part of my series, which covers ETHDenver. Today, I had the honorof meeting with members of the <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/partial-common-ownership/">RadxChange Harberger tax workinggroup</a>. Inthe following sections, I want to iterate on a topic that I deemed relevant andimportant in today&#x2019;s conversation that nicely ties into my previous post oncreating non-skeuomorphic ownership experiences.</p><h2 id="The-Problem-of-Private-Property">The Problem of Private Property</h2><p>Harberger taxes, a topic extensively discussed in &#x201C;Radical Markets&#x201D; and theRadical Exchange movement, is a mechanism for more fairly pricing a particularscarce property. The book features an example of the government in Californiatrying to build a high-speed rail from Los Angeles to San Francisco. And facingthe problem of real estate owners taking advantage of their monopolisticproperty possession when asked by the railway constructor to sell their homes.</p><p>Weyl and Posner argue that the last remaining property owner along thathigh-speed railroad positions themselves monopolistic as, assuming thenecessity for a straight rail, they can leverage their property&#x2019;s geography toask for a price almost as high as it&#x2019;d take to plan and execute an alternativeroute or whatever would be the total cost of the entire high-speed rail projectfailing.</p><p>Within a private property owner&#x2019;s mind, the case is clear: Sell or as high aspossible or drag the whole process out to increase leverage.</p><h2 id="Understanding-Harberger-Properties">Understanding Harberger Properties</h2><p>To address this problem, Weyl and Posner argue that a different way of pricingreal-estate in California could help build the high-speed rail project moreefficiently. Their suggestion is based on the idea that each real estate iscontinuously available for sale and where the owner is voluntarily setting aself-assessed price on which they have to additionally pay a reoccurringpercentual fee: The &#x201C;Harberger tax.&#x201D;</p><p><img src="https://github.com/rugpullindex/libharberger/raw/master/assets/harbergerschema.jpg" alt></p><p>If, e.g., there was a 0.2% Harberger tax on California homes and an owner wouldself-assess their property to be $100k, they&#x2019;d be required to pay $$100000 *0.02 = 200$$ USD worth of Harberger taxes. Interestingly, both the propertybeing continuously on sale and the tax needing to be paid incentivizes theowner to evaluate their property at the possibly most accurate price.</p><p>If they&#x2019;d assess it too low, since it&#x2019;s always on sale, it could be easilypicked up by a property flipper while it&#x2019;d incur unsustainable reoccurringHarberger taxes if it were priced too high.</p><h2 id="Harberger-Property-forks-Private-Property">Harberger Property forks Private Property.</h2><p>What I deemed to be an interesting talking point in today&#x2019;s meeting onHarberger taxes at ETHDenver, however, started as a discussion around measuringa property&#x2019;s turnover rate. Given that setting a property class&#x2019;s tax rate wellmay have to be adjusted dynamically; one argument was that naturally, aproperty owner always has the lowest possible tax rate at interest.</p><p>It makes sense intuitively too. While arguably living in a &#x201C;Harbergeruniverse,&#x201D; so a place where all property is priced using Harberger taxescreates meaningful collective outcomes, a rational individual understanding themonopolistic qualities of private property must want to either lower or abolishtheir Harberger tax as it&#x2019;d mean being able to increase their property&#x2019;s value(without incurring higher total tax costs) or improving their uncertainty ofcontinued ownership.</p><h2 id="&#x201C;Harberger-Escapes&#x201D;">&#x201C;Harberger Escapes&#x201D;</h2><p>So in that case, and since we&#x2019;re heavily hypernormalized in a private propertysociety, a fenced-off Harberger Property system that, e.g., can be created withsmart contracts on Ethereum would always end up having to make sure thatproperty owners don&#x2019;t &#x201C;escape&#x201D; from the &#x201C;Harberger universe&#x201D; into the realm of&#x201C;private property.&#x201D;</p><p>The California railway example goes like this: Assume you&#x2019;re the lastCalifornian property owner, but the state had prior agreed-upon Harbergerpricing. However, through a loophole in the law, you&#x2019;re able to change theproperty owner&#x2019;s name on the deed of ownership. You understand the privateproperty principles, and you&#x2019;re a degen, so you give Wall Street a call andexplain to them your situation: You tell them that you&#x2019;re the last person onthe high-speed rail needing to sell the property: But you don&#x2019;t have enoughcapital to sustain pricing it high until the railway construction company givesin to your demands.</p><p>In that case, Wall Street might give you a loan, or since your property is&#x201C;alwaysonsale&#x201D;, they might buy it from you right away for a higher than usualrate, assuming they can further increase pressure on the railroad constructor.</p><p>Now, in the constructed case of a wet-code law that allows for appropriaterecourse, that may mean that indeed the property will end up being pricedbetter under Harberger law than as private property.</p><p>However, e.g., Harberger properties implemented on Ethereum, that may not bethe case. And that&#x2019;s where the group today had, I think, a slight disagreement.</p><h2 id="Is-ERC721-compatible-with-Harberger-Properties">Is ERC721 compatible with Harberger Properties?</h2><p>Consider the case where we create an ERC721 NFT that is continuously on saleusing Harberger tax mechanics but still is entirely compliant with ERC721. Inthat case, e.g., that <code>transferFrom</code> method might allow sending the deed ofownership from one account to another. But, it also allows an owner to make aninternal accounting transfer where they sent their property from one of theiraccounts to another.</p><p>We want to allow an owner to send their deed of ownership from one address toanother as, e.g., their keys get compromised. Although, this &#x201C;maintenancefunctionality&#x201D; may then easily be abused by owners wanting to &#x201C;Harbergerescape&#x201D; into private property: By selling their property over the counter formore than what it is worth to a buyer, the seller profits from the premiumwhile the buyer profits from lower taxes.</p><p>While it is true that this deal may be fragile as the information the privateagreement was based on could easily leak, and hence the property picked up by asneaky arbitrageur, I still believe &#x201C;Harberger escapes&#x201D; into private propertiescould become a reality.</p><p>I understand my attempt at playing devil&#x2019;s advocate is not ideal yet. However,I feel that it&#x2019;s rather just a challenge of finding a well-enough positionednew owner with just enough opposed interest in Harberger-taxed property. E.g.,if it wasn&#x2019;t enough to keep the deal&#x2019;s basis a secret, then, e.g., a maliciousbuyer&#x2019;s hedge could be some bet directly opposed to the railroad company&#x2019;ssuccess: e.g., shorting its stock.</p><h2 id="Do-we-need-an-ERC721-2-0-for-Harberger-Properties">Do we need an ERC721 2.0 for Harberger Properties?</h2><p>Despite all this skepticism, I&#x2019;m still a firm believer in the idea, while Ibelieve it&#x2019;ll have to carefully be implemented as a fenced-off system for it towork. An elegant solution I have not explored further came from the <a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">GeowebNetwork</a> team that suggested only ever allowing asmart contract to truly &#x201C;privately possess&#x201D; the property.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because what this would allow is anyone being always able to &#x201C;pick up&#x201D; theproperty, particularly in the case of leaked alpha. However, it&#x2019;d meanrestricting the ERC721 token&#x2019;s <code>transferFrom</code> function only to be called by theHarberger tax management contract. Assuming marketplaces like Opensea wouldrecognize this limitation in the collection, it wouldn&#x2019;t pose a problem,whereas I still see the issue of not complying with ERC721.</p><p>There&#x2019;s an implicit private property assumption in ERC721&#x2019;s <code>transferFrom</code>function that&#x2019;d always allow the current owner to send the token to anotheraddress. Interfaces like Metamask and Opensea are built with those assumptionsin mind. While technically approving the transfer with the managing Harbergercontract may be a possibility, I still believe that to cause trouble andconfusion.</p><p>Given our hypernormalized suffering and our need to further buildnon-skeuomorphic ownership models, I&#x2019;d like to argue herein that we should lookbeyond ERC721 and ERC1155 and do everything necessary to abandon theassumptions of private property in all Ethereum infrastructure. Ethereum (andits standards) should &#x201C;get weird,&#x201D; and it shouldn&#x2019;t be opinionated aboutproperty laws: Those should be programmable or configurable.</p><p>Today, I feel grateful for having been given a chance to participate in thismind-opening meeting and work on such awesome intellectually-challenging work.It&#x2019;s great to be here, Denver!</p><h2 id="See-also">See also:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/rugpullindex/libharberger">github.com/rugpullindex/libharberger</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#x2019;m writing these lines with severe dark circles induced by+7h jetlag and intense crypto conference networking.Today&#x2019;s my second day in Denver, and by being an earlybird, I got the chance to participate in Gitcoin&#x2019;sETHDenver satellite event called &#x201C;Schelling Point.&#x201D; In thispost, as in the one yesterday, I reflect on my experiencesat the event.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll start with my day&#x2019;s first highlight, which was thebuilding the event took place. Called &#x201C;the Sports Castle,&#x201D;and indeed seemingly passing the &#x201C;castle glance,&#x201D; is abuilding on Denver&#x2019;s capitol hill that, on closer internalinspection, turns out to be a converted parking garage-madeevent venue.</p><p>While the first floor&#x2019;s low ceiling makes for a partiallyawkward viewing experience of the stage, the former vehicleramps and the building&#x2019;s compactness create an interestingevent vibe. Walking through cheaply assembled cryptostartup booths in a former parking garage made my mindwander.</p><p>But Am I now doing architecture reviews? Yes and no. Ithink I want to mention the space&#x2019;s feel as I found it tobe comically opposed to the space&#x2019;s ascribed value. I&#x2019;veoverheard today that Ethereum&#x2019;s chain alone harbors over$2T in assets today: And still, its community meets in anabandoned parking garage.</p><p>More importantly, though, this image of technicalmisappropriation, although that term may be too negativelyconnotated in the English language, provides an interestingsegue into some conversations I overheard today: Namelythat the crypto-verse and particularly Ethereum with itsprogrammable money allows developers to createnon-skeuomorphic digital experiences. So if in the realworld, a parking garage can become a crypto event&#x2019;s venue,why shouldn&#x2019;t Bored Apes take Rolex&#x2019;s place?</p><p>This idea was further underlined by the event&#x2019;sparticipants and some conversations I had. While there&#x2019;s amutual understanding that buying digital sneakers for ametaverse pod is rather skeuomorphic, that line of thinkingisn&#x2019;t representative of the fact that on the metaverse, youcan be anything: even a boat that chooses to wear Nike&#x2019;s.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s true: Within the blockchain, given our hypernormalized suffering, we&#x2019;ve re-built private property lawsskeumorphically. User&#x2019;s don&#x2019;t have to occupy the propertyto continue owning it; it can&#x2019;t and must not be taken awayforcefully. The individual and their consent ultimatelydetermine pricing before the sale. As a Harbergermaximalist, what comes to mind then is that we&#x2019;vereimplemented private property monopolies without trulyever questioning them. So indeed, it is time to dare anddesign non-skeuomorphism.</p><p>I, for one, appreciate the call for &#x201C;getting weird(er)&#x201D;[again] and the renewed commitment of the space to bothempirical test and theoretically research what works.Besides that, I didn&#x2019;t take much more from Vitalik&#x2019;s talk.He should have mentioned, though, that what they&#x2019;ve alldone with shipping ETH2.0 is a great example of bothempirical and theoretical work going hand-in-hand. Kudos toeveryone that worked on ETH2. You&#x2019;re about to make it!</p><p>Today&#x2019;s event at Denver&#x2019;s Sports Castle was incrediblyintense and worthwhile the visit. I hate to reduce it tothe following, but after two years of not making the crazycrypto conference mingling experience, I can proudly saythat today, though I&#x2019;m incredibly exhausted, I feelaccomplished and happy for having been able to participate.This felt great!</p><p>And in case they&#x2019;ve been recorded and will be releasedonline, I can recommend the following talks:</p><ul><li>Vitalik&#x2019;s keynote speech on empirical and theoretical work</li><li>Beth Mccarthy&#x2019;s &#x201C;Building regenerative culture.&#x201D;</li><li>The panel on &#x201C;Regenerative Cryptoeconomics.&#x201D;</li><li>Glen Weyl&#x2019;s talk on &#x201C;Plurality.&#x201D;</li></ul><p>If you&#x2019;ve enjoyed reading this post, consider checking out yesterday&#x2019;s, too,&#x201C;<a href="/2022/02/16/ethdenver-buidl-week-day-one/">My First Day at BUIDLWEEK &amp;ETHDENVER.</a>&#x201D;</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I arrived in Denver, Colorado, yesterday afternoon, and I plan to attendETHDenver and all its satellite events. Today was my first day at the venues;Strictly speaking, I was at &#x201C;BUIDL week,&#x201D; the event leading up to ETHDenver.The following post is a summary of my impressions.</p><h2 id="COVID-policy">COVID policy</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s start with the most relatable topic: viral infection risk. Today, Ilearned that the US is pretty chill on this topic compared to my hometownBerlin in Germany.</p><p>Before receiving a wrist band, every attendee is run through a supervisedantigen self-test. Admission only proceeds if it&#x2019;s negative. Vaccination isn&#x2019;trequired. Testing procedures are conducted by a company called &#x201C;APEXDiagnostics.&#x201D; Despite some dystopic (&amp; unconfirmed) claims on Twitter, I&#x2019;mexpecting the DNA on my swab not to go into the next best genome database.</p><p>But speaking of chill COVID measures, I&#x2019;ve been told that the Coloradogovernment abandoned the mask-wearing mandate some weeks ago.</p><p>While I find it awesome to mingle in the crowds like in pre-pandemic times, notwearing masks indoors makes me anxious. I&#x2019;m just so used to it. Anyways, I camehere aware of the risks, and I&#x2019;m grateful for participating in a conferenceafter now two years of online-only events and social distancing.</p><h2 id="Venues">Venues</h2><p>ETHDenver has an interesting layout of venues. The event is held in maybe twoor three blocks in the capitol hill district of Denver. Although it wasn&#x2019;timmediately clear to me, it seems that many of the venues are temporarilyconverted nightclubs and bars. I particularly loved the pub-ish vibe that&#x201C;Broadway 1134&#x201D; gave me. Cozy and laid-back.</p><p>But, being severely jetlagged, I also got confused about the various buildings.Particularly since every other building not hosting official ETHDenver eventsis still hosting some different blockchain protocol&#x2019;s event. That&#x2019;s whystrolling down Denver&#x2019;s &#x201C;Broadway,&#x201D; I suddenly found myself at &#x201C;AlgoRanch,&#x201D; acompanion event by Algorand.</p><h2 id="People">People</h2><p>I realized today that what I appreciate most about conferences is theopportunity to meet and get to know completely random people quickly. Comingfrom cold-hearted Berlin to a US conference is just so refreshing. Everyonehere is so outgoing, friendly, and an ice-breaking expert. I&#x2019;ve already hadsome entirely random but meaningful conversations, and I appreciate that!</p><h2 id="Talks">Talks</h2><p>I haven&#x2019;t attended any talks yet. I listened with one ear to what was said at1134 by Foresight Institute, but that&#x2019;s about it. I&#x2019;m searching for serioustechnical talks: Let me know if you have suggestions for the upcoming days.</p><h2 id="Denver">Denver</h2><p>My first impression of Denver is that it&#x2019;s completely different from west andeast coast cities like NY or SF/LA. Is its climate continental? I&#x2019;d argue so asI had strolled around downtown yesterday with just a pullover while there&#x2019;scurrently a snow storm jamming the city&#x2019;s infrastructure.</p><p>Speaking of structure: I love the grid US cities have implemented with streetsand avenues. Also, cars drive much slower than in Berlin. At least in downtown,it seems that also helps with reducing noise pollution. Cool!</p><p>I&#x2019;m impressed by Denver&#x2019;s skyscrapers, but in my mind, they don&#x2019;t add up. Thismorning, to get a coffee, I saw all the tall buildings but no people aroundthem. How&#x2019;s that possible? Shouldn&#x2019;t a 20 story building cause some heftypedestrian traffic?</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>That&#x2019;s all I have for today. I&#x2019;m planning to do more of these posts during theevent. If you have suggestions of other topics, I should cover, please reachout to me. And if you want to meet in person, please also get in touch!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Optimism describes a social behavior whereby individuals or groups tend tofavor evaluating a subject&#x2019;s positive sides rather than seeking to balancetheir view by also considering negatives.</p><p>We deem optimism as toxic when its application or incidence occurs excessivelyor as a form of denial of a skewed perception of reality.</p><h2 id="The-Itch-of-Positivity">The Itch of Positivity</h2><p>Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartleby,_the_Scrivener">I&#x2019;d prefer notto</a>, I want to startthis essay with a personal anecdote, namely when I first helped co-create aplatform for upvoting submissions in university. For a portal to collect anddiscuss privacy patterns, as a frontend developer, I helped set up<a href="https://privacypatterns.eu">privacypatterns.eu</a> whose supposed goal was tobubble up the best patterns for improved privacy.</p><p>Rather quickly, a discussion ensued around the concepts of upvoting anddownvoting patterns with my colleagues responsible for maintaining thedatabase.</p><p>Already seven years ago, surprisingly, we were all intimately familiar withsites like Facebook and Reddit that served as role models for our site. We knewthat FB&#x2019;s &#x201C;Like&#x201D; acted as an upvote-only function, whereas Reddit allowed usersto express nominal negativity too.</p><p>But apart from getting lost in thought, I still remember not involving myselfmuch in the conversation as I found it to be over my head. And I can&#x2019;t sayfor sure if the following seven years of software engineering make it anyeasier thinking about this topic today.</p><p>I have, however, managed to curate a persevering itch telling me that exclusivepositivity on social media platforms must lead to detrimental outcomes. Andrecently, I&#x2019;ve felt becoming a victim of toxic positivity increasingly. Withthis post, I now want to detail the charms of that itch.</p><h2 id="The-Curse-of-Positivity">The Curse of Positivity</h2><p>Interestingly, they say that to be successful on social media; One has topresent their most authentic self. And logically, this statement then mandatesasking if human billboard Gary Vaynerchuk was indeed born with an authentic buthighly <em>commercial</em> personality or if his behavior is merely a professionalshtick to sell more NFTs.</p><p>Similarly, after wanting to understand if people really like Logan Paul andKSI&#x2019;s new &#x201C;PRIME&#x201D; soft drink, naively I youtube&#x2019;d &#x201C;prime review&#x201D; only to comeacross a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk2UDs8wXKI">video</a> of &#x201C;No LifeShaq,&#x201D; a dude that &#x201C;got big off purely big-upping everyone.&#x201D; His surprisingverdict: It tastes A M A Z I N G.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/big-upping.png" alt></p><p>And while I may now fall into the category of &#x201C;hating ass clowns,&#x201D; I have tosay that I would have wished to click on a more critical review of thebeverage.</p><p>See, I don&#x2019;t feel like the collective soyfacing of Tesla is necessarily a badthing for society, considering that it may have contributed to awakening theSwabian automobile giants to make more fuel-efficient cars. Similarly, Ibelieve that the CO2 criticism of cryptocurrencies will continue to have apositive effect on the field.</p><p>Although, I feel there&#x2019;s now a class of positivity, stirred up by disjointinterest, which outcomes I&#x2019;d mostly describe as toxic.</p><p>But the narrative of favoring optimistic quantitative engagement on socialmedia platforms is still controversially discussed way beyond my littlewebsite.</p><p>Most prominently, with Youtube recently removing the dislike count from videosto reduce bullying on the platform. Seemingly challenged to make a rationalargument, the dislike button&#x2019;s proponents now claim that they cannotdifferentiate good from bad tutorial videos.</p><h2 id="Getting-Ratioed">Getting Ratioed</h2><p>Though, what that argument misses is a conversation about getting<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ratioed">ratioed</a> and itsdetrimental effects on the creator&#x2019;s soul. And as someone that has had <a href="https://plausible.io/timdaub.github.io?period=12mo">32.1kimpressions</a> from HackerNews while writing a column about cryptocurrencies and web3, I, for one, canconfidently claim to be a convincing witness of &#x201C;getting ratioed.&#x201D;</p><p>The other day, I had the stupid idea of reviving one of my most popular postscalled &#x201C;web3 is a stupid idea&#x201D; by re-submitting it to /r/ethereum. And whilethe post had some genuine negativity around Ethereum&#x2019;s vision of creating aweb3 and not an internet2, I&#x2019;d argue that the post&#x2019;s message ends up being afriendly riff on Ethereum&#x2019;s mainstream vision.</p><p>Although I knew the post had previously done extraordinarily well on theweb3-critical Hacker News, I wasn&#x2019;t ready for Reddit&#x2019;s rude reaction.</p><p>Just seconds after posting, I was being called a &#x201C;cranky monkey&#x201D; just &#x201C;bitchingabout web3.&#x201D; While I tried to defuse the situation with humor, the broadercommunity agreed with the premature headline reader by upvoting their rudecomment.</p><p>And so, after just a few hours, and in a phase of my self-confidencediminishing, I deleted the post and arranged with myself to further limit myinvolvement with the /r/ethereum community. Screw them.</p><h2 id="Negativity-Through-Toxic-Positivity">Negativity Through Toxic Positivity</h2><p>Now, understandably one may say that my experience had little to do withwitnessing &#x201C;toxic positivity&#x201D; as most of the above-mentioned reactions stemmedfrom negativity. But I&#x2019;d, hereon, like to argue that I believe their source isexcessive optimism towards the project and that it stems from short-termmonetary interest.</p><p>In the case of Reddit communities or Hacker News, this way of banishing membersof the potential out-group allows the group&#x2019;s delusion to survive. &#x201C;<a href="https://nav.al/failure">GroupsNever Admit Failure</a>,&#x201D; and indeed, if we&#x2019;d think aboutgroups huddling around excessive negativity, then we&#x2019;d notice a similar effect.</p><h2 id="Critical-Crypto-Currencies">Critical Crypto Currencies</h2><p>With the cryptocurrency market almost having morphed into a bear recently, ithas become a source of relaxation for me.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve found the excessive hyping and nonsense noise in the last year difficultto deal with. I&#x2019;m not mad that we&#x2019;ve received more attention than usual. But Ithink my spot of comfort is in a market that isn&#x2019;t entirely irrational anddriven by boom and bust.  Maybe I like me some good old crypto winters.</p><p>Or, and that I&#x2019;d prefer, the crypto market and its moonbois just grow up andlearn to deal with critique professionally.</p><p>As a long-term believer of the space&#x2019;s visions, I&#x2019;d argue that only highlycritical contact with the subject matter will lead to excellent results overthe long term. So I&#x2019;d be happy to see less hilarity and more humbleness.</p><hr><h2 id="Further-reading">Further reading</h2><ul><li><a href="/#writing">All posts</a></li><li>2021-02-22: <a href="/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">Ethereum isn&#x2019;t fun anymore</a></li><li>2021-12-15: <a href="/2021/12/15/token-holders-arent-slaying-moloch/">Are Token Holders Slaying Moloch?</a></li><li>2020-09-08: <a href="/2020/09/08/web3/">web3 is a stupid idea (&#x1F50A;)</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Written by: <a href="https://github.com/pinkiebell">pinkiebell</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/timdaub">TimDaub</a>.</strong></p><p>Composability is a quality of EVM-based smart contract singletons to expose animmutable and openly-accessible API. The property of composability inEthereum-based smart contracts paired with the tokenization of assets made itpossible to create Decentralized Finance (short: &#x201C;DeFi&#x201D;), crypto currencies&#x2019;greatest driver of innovation yet.</p><p>If &#x201C;2022 is the year of the DAO&#x201D;, then all years prior were probably &#x201C;the yearsof financial composability&#x201D; as this unique property of smart contracts hasgiven rise to the most innovative monetary applications developers have everseen before.</p><p>But <strong>is it time to move on from Solidity-level composability?</strong> Is it worthbreaking it for the sake of scalability and utility of the overall Ethereumnetwork? A discussion.</p><h2 id="Composability-software&#x2019;s-greatest-property">Composability, software&#x2019;s greatest property?</h2><p>First of all, the concept of composability isn&#x2019;t new, and EVM-based languagesdidn&#x2019;t invent it either.</p><p>We argue that most readers will likely be intimately familiar with the last bigcomposability paradigm shift in software engineering. It was all web developersagreeing on making their web APIs RESTful.</p><p>By using JSON and being mindful of the shared state on the web, we managed tosuccessfully scale the web into a broadly-useful network of services. It&#x2019;s whytoday, most programming languages ironically include the &#x201C;<strong>JavaScript</strong> ObjectNotation&#x201D; (short: &#x201C;JSON&#x201D;), as with the adoption of the REST composabilityparadigm, it has become the most popular serialization format.</p><p>We, hence, define the term composability independently from EVM-basedinterfaces. We say that two distinct pieces of software are composable whentheir interfaces allow them to be used together.</p><p>Given that definition, we argue that properly semantically-versioned opensource software is &#x201C;composable,&#x201D; as are POSIX-compliant tools.</p><p>Still, Solidity smart contract composability differs as it does not only allowprograms to collaborate on managing information but money. Hence, Ethereum&#x2019;scomposability property is innovative as it enables gluing together variousfinancial applications.</p><p>However, in the past month, we&#x2019;ve come to realize that today&#x2019;s composability ofEVM-based contracts more of an obstacle than a beneficiary feature to all.</p><h2 id="DeFi-Ethereum&#x2019;s-&#x201C;Poster-Child&#x201D;">DeFi, Ethereum&#x2019;s &#x201C;Poster Child&#x201D;</h2><p>We probably don&#x2019;t have to convince anyone of the greatness of DeFi. But for anycrypto hodlers awaking from cryostasis, YES, Ethereum&#x2019;s killer application hasbeen found, and it&#x2019;s DeFi.</p><p>DeFi is such a great killer application that it has started to impact theviability of other use cases on Ethereum. It&#x2019;s because it has made usingEthereum very expensive.</p><p>See, the problem is in DeFi degen on-chain trading. Before the advent ofautomated market makers (short &#x201C;AMM&#x201D;), using Ethereum was fairly cheap, withtransaction fees ranging from a few cents to maybe a dollar or two.</p><p>Only with the &#x201C;recent&#x201D; influx of on-chain trading has it become widespread andrationally accepted that any transaction goes for as long as it&#x2019;s profitable.If you inspect the chain today, you&#x2019;ll find that some traders in the past tookon massive costs to execute trades with only dubious profit. To draw an extremepicture, we argue that it may technically be rational to pay the equivalent of999 ETH in transaction cost just to make back 999.000000000000000001 ETH(difference: 1 WEI) of profit in the process.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because traders can control Ethereum&#x2019;s transaction atomicity andprofitability to a fair degree until the very moment of execution. In contrastto an intransparent order book of a centralized Wall Street exchange,Ethereum&#x2019;s transaction pool is entirely inspectable by any participants,allowing them to &#x201C;guarantee&#x201D; certain results.</p><p>And beyond just that, much more is possible through specifying conditions inSolidity (and recently MEV):</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">require(profit &gt; msg.value, &quot;non profitable trade&quot;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Gas-change-is-real">Gas-change is real!</h2><p>At this point, it should hence not surprise anyone when we claim thatmarket-based pricing may not reflect the inclusion of external costs.</p><p>On Ethereum, the egoistic behavior or running every DeFi trade possible as longas it&#x2019;s profitable comes with the external cost of forcing less viable projectsto migrate to, e.g., other chains. Is that digital gentrification?</p><p>For sure, though, it&#x2019;s a real problem that has led to shifting dynamics in theworld of software development.</p><p>While it may have formerly been acceptable to put the entirety of a dapp&#x2019;stransactions on-chain, today, it&#x2019;s a really bad idea. Heuristically, it hascome to mean that if a decentralized application doesn&#x2019;t provide the equivalentvalue of, say, DeFi provides to traders, then this non-DeFi application islikely to have a hard time competing for viability - given its enormous gascosts.</p><p>A striking example of this may have been the abandoning of Aragon and thesimultaneous rise in popularity of <a href="http://snapshot.org">snapshot.org</a> voting. While Aragon used toput all transactions on-chain to implement a mixture of token voting andmulti-signature wallet, today&#x2019;s <a href="http://snapshot.org">snapshot.org</a> off-chains the whole vote bydefault and leaves solving the multi-signature use case to others (e.g., GnosisSafe).</p><p>But by and large, the above-described dynamic visualizes the space&#x2019;s greatestproblem well: It&#x2019;s that if your non-financial application isn&#x2019;t capable ofproviding similar viability to DeFi, then we&#x2019;re better off not building it onEthereum.</p><h2 id="Future-State-Will-Be-Expensive-Too">Future State Will Be Expensive Too</h2><p>Those who understand the dilemma of scaling blockchains, as, e.g., Vitalik hadlaid it out in one of his blog posts [1], also must realize that state beingcompetitively-priced isn&#x2019;t going to go away in the future.</p><p>Not to say that it may eventually get cheap when we all start owningsuper-fancy quantum computers. But until those unlikely inventions becomerealities, we&#x2019;d argue that state will remain expensive. It&#x2019;ll stay expensive onEthereum, and the market will take care of equating prices between peripheralchains like Polygon.</p><p>For those that don&#x2019;t understand or value the original concept of storing stateon blockchains, it may continue to be cheap. After all, there&#x2019;s always adatabase or less secure chain to store it on.</p><p>But for those that value the guarantees that Ethereum and other projects werebuilt upon, state will continue to be competitively priced.</p><h2 id="Why-We&#x2019;re-Arguing-For-Breaking-Solidity-level-Composability">Why We&#x2019;re Arguing For Breaking Solidity-level Composability</h2><p>In the end, breaking composability with Ethereum smart contracts can mean manydifferent things in practice. Rollups and L2 contracts exemplify composabilityparadigms being actively broken and &#x201C;moved upwards.&#x201D; Yes, calling &#x201C;through toL2&#x201D; will one day be a possibility; but other roll-up architects may want toconsider more extreme variants to increase scalability.</p><p>We, the authors, have experimented with breaking composability for the sake ofreducing gas costs by selectively applying some principles used in roll-upstoo. While roll-ups have come to define themselves as a combination oftrustless bridges and on-chain data validation, through experimentation, wefound that breaking composability can significantly reduce contracts&#x2019; gas costsby deliberately applying L2-scaling strategies to regular L1 contracts.</p><p>In this article, we call for breaking the Solidity-level composability as,e.g., adding gas-optimizations to the Solidity compiler or using, e.g., sparseMerkle trees as alternative state storage may indeed save significant levels ofgas for the user but can lead to incompatibilities with traditional contractsthat rely on the composable Ethereum message call interface [2].</p><p>If e.g., we&#x2019;d break the composability of ERC20 tokens and allow those contractsto batch validate transfers, we&#x2019;d make everyone in DeFi unhappy as we&#x2019;d nowrequire everyone to submit their transactions through an off-chain sequencerrather than the standard (&amp; composable) Solidity call interface.</p><p>Suddenly, calling a third-party contract&#x2019;s <code>transferFrom</code> would stop beingstraightforward. As composability was broken on the Solidity level, it&#x2019;d likelyrequire us to set up a sequencing server as well.</p><p>We want to argue that we believe that making deliberate breaking changes to theecosystem&#x2019;s architecture would benefit it over the long term. We think thecurrent stateful composability paradigm for L1 contracts blocks scaling, andnew solutions will have to be discovered.</p><p>Distributed systems have a high computational overhead in comparison to theircentralized counterparts. Thus, using those systems only for the minimum viableenforcement is a requirement if we want them to be the &#x201C;World&#x2019;s Computer.&#x201D; Asdevelopers, we must agree and accept that on-chain state and its validation isa scarce resource and should be treated with economic care. Posting data to theblockchain is cheap; transforming and storing it is expensive.</p><p>Hence, we propose to move the composability to another layer withoutsacrificing security to receive better scaling results.</p><p><strong>Written by: <a href="https://github.com/pinkiebell">pinkiebell</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/timdaub">TimDaub</a>.</strong></p><h2 id="References">References</h2><ul><li>1:<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html">https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html</a></li><li>2:<a href="https://github.com/rugpullindex/indexed-sparse-merkle-tree">https://github.com/rugpullindex/indexed-sparse-merkle-tree</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year started out with a new year&#x2019;s resolution of using even less socialmedia than in 2021. As my diet now excludes Reddit and Hacker News, for thelast two days, I&#x2019;ve been aimlessly browsing the web in search for interestingstuff. It&#x2019;s quite boring out there&#x2026; Do I feel cold turkey? Am I OK???</p><p>But for some reason, this morning, I ended up checking out an article of<a href="https://thedefiant.io/">thedefiant</a> and saw that they use a neat little sitecalled &#x201C;<a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">unlock protocol</a>&#x201D; as a crypto-nativemonetization mechanism. I immediately got excited as I love me a simple buthonest implementation of some &#x201C;future tech.&#x201D; For the definat, the unlockprotocol is a generic paywall they put in front of their posts so that usersare asked to pay before they can access content.</p><p>With my curiosity caught, I went on Unlock&#x2019;s GitHub and looked at their code. Ialso stalked their employees (as you do, right?) and their founder. In fact, Isuddenly found myself on the <a href="https://www.ouvre-boite.com/">founder&#x2019;s blog</a>playing with the Unlock paywall integration (the founder&#x2019;s blog is using ittoo). Actually, I was even interested in giving it a shot. The blog postssounded interesting, so I tried to become a &#x201C;member&#x201D;:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/hyperfollow.png" alt></p><p>Both on Desktop and Mobile, the intergration that Unlock Protocol did withWalletConnect and Metamask is neatly done. I even had to sign something and I wasguided nicely through the process.</p><p>But then came the step that involved paying money and there I was basicallykicked in the stomach. Paying was only possible with xDAI&#x2026;</p><p><img src="/assets/images/xdaicheckout.png" alt></p><h2 id="The-Multichain-Future-is-Multi-Problematic">The Multichain Future is Multi Problematic</h2><p>See, had my wallet contained xDAI then surely I would have paid for thearticle, enjoyed reading it and moved on with my life. But it didn&#x2019;t and so nowI&#x2019;m upset for missing out on the article but also because I&#x2019;m realizing thatthe problem is far bigger than Unlock Protocol&#x2019;s unlucky checkout page.</p><p>It&#x2019;s that the ecosystem has falsely promoted the &#x201C;multichain is the future&#x201D;narrative, without properly thinking about its consequences.</p><p>A quick intermittened definition of what I mean by &#x201C;multichain&#x201D; is that insteadof picking and transaction on one chain to rule them all (e.g. Ethereum orBitcoin), a multichain application would feature support for many differentchains (e.g. Ethereum and Bitcoin and Polkadot and Tezos).</p><p>I almost feel reactionary to say this right now, but multichain is reallyproblematic. And that isn&#x2019;t news.</p><p>Already in 2017 and before, some crypto currency enthusiasts went on stagespublicly and proclaimed a &#x201C;multicoin future&#x201D; and that later on, it won&#x2019;t reallymatter what coins we&#x2019;re transacting with. The same people later proclaimed thatDAI and USDC are to the USD what file formats like .jpg and .png are to images.</p><p>Clearly, and also undeniably, there&#x2019;s not only qualitative changes to .png,.jgp or DAI and USDC - promoting such a reductionistic view point is simplyharmful for everyone wanting to work by applying reason. For sure, there&#x2019;ssomething uniquely good about arguing for interoperability; but I remainskeptical about the motivation&#x2019;s of those that call for it.</p><p>A call for a multichain future or a call for interoperability is often just acompetitor&#x2019;s call for taking over market share through moral highground.</p><h2 id="Multichain-Has-A-Terrible-User-Experience">Multichain Has A Terrible User Experience</h2><p>But that aside, multichain simply has dreadful user experience. Had the Unlockfounder asked me to pay Ether, a widly distributed asset, then far more userswould be capable of also buying. However, since I&#x2019;m asked to pay xDAI, I&#x2019;mimplicitly also asked to bridge some amount of DAI (which I may not own either)onto the xDAI chain. That&#x2019;s where the &#x201C;Multichain is the future&#x201D; vision fallsapart for me, because it&#x2019;s just a nightmare.</p><p>I just want to consume a simple blog post and I&#x2019;m not at all interested inbridging assets to a myriad number of other networks. How much DAI should Ibuy?  What&#x2019;ll be the transaction costs? How do I bridge safely to the xDAInetwork? Hell, maybe I&#x2019;ve never heard of xDAI before?</p><p>Having money on multiple networks for investing already, honestly, it justleaves me anxious and frankly I&#x2019;ve started losing oversight. A few Satoshisthere, a couple of Weis on ETC&#x2026; Or was it ETH?</p><p>Also: I don&#x2019;t feel comfortable with bridging either. Last time I checked,bridges are often semi-decentralized and therefore sem-safe. I don&#x2019;t want topay the risk of bridging, I don&#x2019;t want to risk my funds during bridging and I&#x2019;dappreciate paying as little transaction costs as possible.</p><p>So for me, not having a balance on xDAI, would it be more expensive to sendEther on Ethereum&#x2019;s L1 or bridging to xDAI? Clearly, sending Ether on L1 wouldbe cheaper. I&#x2019;d pay more than $5 for the membership in L1 transaction fees; butonboarding to xDAI I&#x2019;d have to pay that too.</p><p>Now, of course, you could argue that &#x201C;hey Tim, but once you&#x2019;ve bridged to xDAIyour transaction&#x2019;s are cheap&#x201D;. But, I&#x2019;d like to reject that argument as there&#x2019;donly be little probability for your next on-chain action to be xDAI related.It&#x2019;s because the multichain paradigm doesn&#x2019;t consider factoring in a user&#x2019;schain choice.</p><h2 id="Multichain-Makes-Developer-Experience-Dreadful-too">Multichain Makes Developer Experience Dreadful too</h2><p>From the perspective of a developer, the experience is equally bleak.</p><p>Unless you&#x2019;ve ICO&#x2019;ed a sick token the other year and, hence, have a shit tonof shitcoins to pay for coders, really the &#x201C;Multichain future&#x201D; is entirelyunobtainable.</p><p>Isn&#x2019;t it hard enough to ship something of quality to a single chain already?Who has time to support five other full nodes, watch three other eventendpoints and write code that works for six different networks but alwaysslightly differently?</p><p>Multichain is or will be dreaded by every developer. But even business typeswill eventually start disliking it once they&#x2019;ve run the numbers that themultichain vision also means fragmenting their community. Multichain means lessmoney for more code. I just don&#x2019;t wanna do it.</p><h2 id="Why-Multichain-then">Why Multichain then?</h2><p>People love the Multichain idea because it allows them to dream of use casesthat&#x2019;d only be possible if we were further into the crypto currency future.xDAI, Polygon and BSC offer developers features that are simply unobtainable onsecure and decentralied chains like Ethereum&#x2019;s L1 today. Many are sick of gasfees, they hate not being able to build their product given high storage costs.</p><p>We want what we can&#x2019;t have. We want super fast and cheap transactions. Thefuture of Unlock Protocol would be so bright if only all blockchaintransactions would finalize so fast as on xDAI. Why can&#x2019;t everybody bridgetheir DAI onto it then?  Why are we still stuck with Ethereum transactionscosting hundreds of dollars?</p><p>But, the proponents of the multichain paradigm purposefully ignore that scalingblockchain to unsustainable limits <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html">isn&#x2019;treal</a>. Decentralizedblockchains can&#x2019;t scale as Polygon does today. They may never scale that well!</p><p>And even today, its become incredible costly and hard to run and keep a BSCnode online. Some even say, running a BSC node is &#x201C;<a href="https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553">a lostcause</a>&#x201D;.</p><p>Additionally, many side chains contain immature and centrally managed code.Polygon, BSC and others offer dramatically different security guarantees ase.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p><p>Such dramatic guarantees that just recently, a bug that that put<a href="https://medium.com/immunefi/polygon-lack-of-balance-check-bugfix-postmortem-2-2m-bounty-64ec66c24c7d">~9,276,584,332MATIC</a>(or $20,594,017,217!) at risk, was fixed over-night through <a href="https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/commit/488ea2bcb4d9771e05b1fad12d8b86562558aab5">overwritingPolygon&#x2019;s bridgebytecode</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, the multichain paradigm has caught on as the big network&#x2019;s puninessstarted showing in last year&#x2019;s hype cycle. But unless we want to reintroducedatabases for managing money transfers, I think it&#x2019;s time to accept thatinsecure side chains and the multichain paradigm aren&#x2019;t a quick fix to some ofthe space&#x2019;s trickiest problems.</p><p>The rule is simple: If a dapp doesn&#x2019;t provide equal or more value to a userthan the current transaction cost on a strongly decentralized chain, then it&#x2019;sprobably not worth building.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a huge epiphany moment when in early 2018, <a href="https://github.com/ameensol">AmeenSoleimani</a> et al.  launched&#x201C;<a href="https://www.molochdao.com/">MolochDAO</a>,&#x201D; an organization founded on the ideathat systemically flawed processes originate from game theoretical failures. Itwas nice that the summarized the idea as the gestalt of &#x201C;Moloch&#x201D;: The god ofcoordination failure, that by the way, loves children being sacrificed. Butthat just on the side. Here&#x2019;s a picture of a Moloch statue.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/moloch.jpg" alt="&quot;Wow, imagine you built this statue and showed it to your friends. That&apos;d be hellacringe.&quot;"></p><p>The start was a blog post by infamous blogger <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Slate StarCodex</a> titled &#x201C;<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Meditations OnMoloch</a>,&#x201D; which Iconsider a must-read in neo-actuary online literature for crypto-mindedmoonbois. But for real: &#x201C;Meditations on Moloch&#x201D; is indeed a mindblowing post,particularly when you&#x2019;ve never been exposed to such ideas.</p><p>It&#x2019;d be foolish for me to summarize or indicate any other greater understandingof its ideas, but I want to reiterate the broader context:</p><p>Scott Alexander, the author of the Slate Star Codex, is known to be arationalist thinker and in their post they make an argument for why some gamesinevitably lead to coordination failure.</p><p>A classic example of such failure can be observed, e.g., the Prisoner&#x2019;sDilemma. At least, if we were capable of spectating in &#x201C;god view&#x201D; upon thesituation. I&#x2019;m not gonna re-iterate the prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma either: But I cansay that for a god it&#x2019;s fairly obvious to recommend bilateral cooperation asthis results in both prisoners being freed. The dilemma stemming from bothprisoners having severely limited capability of collective rational decisionmaking. Here&#x2019;s a flow chart of the participants&#x2019; choices.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/prisoners.png" alt></p><p>And while the game is deliberately framed to provoke the dilemma, it is arather practical problem in today&#x2019;s world. It&#x2019;s particularly useful tounderstand as it highlights other practical concepts we&#x2019;re currently not ableto solve, e.g. the tragedy of the commons.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because when our decision impacts another number of individuals, thendecision-making through individual rationality may not have the same outcomesas through collective rationality.</p><p>You can intuitively comprehend this as you too have once been part of such afailure. E.g. when during a presentation you were forced to stand up as othersin front of you did so earlier too. Clearly, it&#x2019;d make sense for everyone tojust remain seated - until of course a single person makes the choice ofstanding for them and all others in the back.</p><p>And the avid reader of this blog might now also recognize this type of topic:I&#x2019;ve written about similar rationalistic decision-making failure before when Iclaimed that &#x201C;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">On-chain, The Emperor Wears NoClothes</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>However, to stay on point hence, when Scott Alexander calls Moloch the god ofcoordination failure, they&#x2019;re deliberately invoking the devil himself as ascapegoat of collective suffering.</p><p>But I wouldn&#x2019;t be writing this post today if it wasn&#x2019;t for rethorically longingfor the message I&#x2019;ve put in the headline. That &#x201C;token holders aren&#x2019;t slayingMoloch.&#x201D;</p><p>It&#x2019;s because, years ago, the cryptosphere discovered the Moloch-logic as anexistential motive of their own and a reassurance of their work beinghonerable.  And it is indeed honerable at face-value solving the greatcoordination problems of our times. Somehow that work must yield positiveoutcomes.</p><p>However, through working in the space long-enough, I&#x2019;ve come to witness thatsadly, the Moloch-idea has been wrongly co-opted by the space to further thenumber-go-up ideal. Or, at least some projects exhibit this type of quality.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not talking about the actual MolochDAO design itself and neither aboutAmeen&#x2019;s work.  But I&#x2019;ve come to see the term &#x201C;slaying moloch&#x201D; being used bypeople that say one thing but do another. Maybe not for the wrong intentions;but surely while being on the wrong path.</p><p>Actually, I&#x2019;m happy to double down on my previous claims stating thatcollectivizing and finanicalizing decision-making isn&#x2019;t a sufficient solutionto slaying Moloch. &#x201C;Being rich or right&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t &#x201C;slaying Moloch&#x201D;. Launching yetanother token isn&#x2019;t either.</p><p>Clearly, as we&#x2019;ve understood with <a href="https://youtu.be/ws06adOKNUk?t=32">Francis Haugentalking</a>, financial collectivism cannot bethe solution to a game theory problem like the tragedy of the commons.  It&#x2019;sbecause despite Facebook knowing of the evil it does to people around the worldby failing to properly content-moderate in many languages, it still does thosethings, for profit.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws06adOKNUk" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><em>Video language is in english from 32 seconds on-ward&#x2026;</em></p><p>Here, there&#x2019;s the same coordinatiorial problem as within games like the tragedyof the commons or the prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma. Technically everybody could startparticipating in Facebook by buying stock and start profiting from all itsawesome vision of &#x201C;connecting people&#x201D;. But it&#x2019;d also mean being complicit witha company that has been involved in genocide but doesn&#x2019;t really care. Besides,joining financial collectivism doesn&#x2019;t automatically give you reasonabledecision-making power.</p><p>Clearly, there&#x2019;s still a great misalignment between Facebook, the people ofMyanmar, and its stakeholders. Likewise, in the case of the 2016 US election,there was a giant misalignment between some states, Cambridge Analytica, thecandidates, and everyone that believes in the US constitution.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not saying that going from individual rational decision-making tocollective decision-making is useless: What I&#x2019;m saying is that using the sameold capitalistic tricks is just leading to skeuomorphistic digital capitalism2.0. Would DeFi-facebook really be better than today&#x2019;s TradFi-facebook?

    <updated>2021-12-10T14:49:36.000Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#x2019;s now two years since the first time I published on this website. So it&#x2019;sroughly 24 months. I just counted; I managed to release 28 blog posts untiltoday. Actually, it&#x2019;s an impressive number. I&#x2019;m surprised it&#x2019;s 28, and I wouldhave maybe guessed it&#x2019;s 15.</p><p>The front page now looks kind of how I like it. It&#x2019;s bursting with originality,and it&#x2019;s slightly intimidating. I&#x2019;m happy about the information section on thetop, enumerating all my social information, like my GitHub account and relatedhandles. But it&#x2019;s kinda difficult to understand the depth of the &#x201C;Writing&#x201D;section, though. There&#x2019;s a lot to take in.</p><p>I dislike that the blog has no name and that I&#x2019;m still hosting it on&#x201C;&#x2026;github.io&#x201D;. That&#x2019;s against my principles, as I want to own my namespace.But I don&#x2019;t feel like fighting it either. The &#x201C;.github.io&#x201D; handle is also kindanice because it symbolizes that this is a technical blog.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve started disliking the blog&#x2019;s theme recently. Specifically, how it looks onmobile devices. I just find it odd that on the root page, the navigation is ontop, while it is on the bottom when reading an article. I really don&#x2019;t needthis &#x201C;Share&#x201D; dialogue, and I doubt that my readers naturally understand what&#x201C;TOC&#x201D; means (it stands for &#x201C;Table Of Content&#x201D;).</p><p>When visiting an article on mobile, an additional problem is that it&#x2019;s unclearwhat website they&#x2019;re on. In &#x201C;reading mode&#x201D;, my blog has no header indicatingthat it also hosts other content. There&#x2019;s no affordance telling the user that&#x201C;this is a blog.&#x201D; They probably expect to find information on the top, butthere&#x2019;s none.</p><p>I like the /projects page, and I try to update it regularly. I think it&#x2019;s beendoing wonders for my external technical credibility. As the web has become aspace of beguilers, I notice the importance of having an online CV thatconfirms my technical capabilities.</p><p>About the visitor numbers on <a href="http://plausible.io">plausible.io</a>, I&#x2019;m happing with the recent uptickin SEO-related traffic. Actually, I&#x2019;ve been obsessing over it recently. I wantto prove to myself that I am a writer whose words can impact the world. It&#x2019;shard even to prove it to myself: But I&#x2019;ve come to believe that there&#x2019;s morethan just clicks and retention numbers. I like to think that, sometimes, when Ipublish, I actually change or inform people&#x2019;s decisions. I imagine that peoplewho run crypto startups read my posts and become influenced.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s so hard to name just a minor impact with certainty. I mean, I knowthat my posts are having an impact as most of my freelance clients in the lasttwo years have originated directly from this website. I know that I&#x2019;m havingthe attention of some influential people in the crypto space. But I could neversay so, as there isn&#x2019;t any connecting proof or public displayable clue.</p><p>I&#x2019;m happy to see my email subscriber list on <a href="http://substack.com">substack.com</a> grow, and I&#x2019;m gladabout having reached 60 Discord members on my Rug Pull Index server, but I&#x2019;mcraving for more. I think what I want is to have the freedom of exploring myintellectual curiosity by being more financially free.</p><p>I like working for the projects I have right now, but I often feel like beingcapable of solving much harder problems. I often ponder before descending intorabbit holes; it&#x2019;s because of the anxiety of not working on &#x201C;paid problems.&#x201D;It&#x2019;s probably irrational; but I&#x2019;m fearing to harm my financial status andcareer by tackling too complex technical problems.</p><p>With my blog here on <a href="http://timdaub.github.io">timdaub.github.io</a>, I&#x2019;ve started seeing myself as somewhatof a tech columnist, and I&#x2019;ve also wondered what exactly it is what I&#x2019;m doing.By no means do I have any reasonable understanding of journalism, and probablyit&#x2019;s one of those occupations I would have never thought to touch with my work.But I&#x2019;m now frequently asking myself if what I&#x2019;m doing isn&#x2019;t a form ofjournalism, really. If words, sentences, language and terminology are suchexciting concepts, do I even want to have a monolithic career in buildingsoftware?</p><p>Prompted by my blogging success, I started journaling my thoughts offline too.And recently, I&#x2019;ve come to better understand the meaning behind &#x201C;journaling.&#x201D;</p><p>Today, through this structured effort expressing my thoughts on the latestdevelopments in the cryptosphere, I almost understand it as a craft or art. Istill spend a lot of time on <a href="http://plausible.io">plausible.io</a>, checking my post&#x2019;s stats. But I&#x2019;malso mindfully emphasizing the idea that if I write something I personally findmeaningfully, that then others will come to appreciate that too.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve had phases where all that counted was clicks: That&#x2019;s how &#x201C;web3 is a stupididea&#x201D; and &#x201C;Ethereum isn&#x2019;t fun anymore&#x201D; were written. But reading those piecesnow, I&#x2019;m not too impressed by their assertions and rhetoric.</p><p>I love how well I optimized those posts for doing well on social platforms.Still, I am truly proud of posts that challenged me intellectually when I wrotethem.</p><p>For example, I&#x2019;m happy to be the second person to write about &#x201C;Sleepminting.&#x201D;I&#x2019;m proud of myself for discovering the connection of deontic and epistemicauthority in financial and technical stakeholders (&#x201C;On-chain, The Emperor WearsNo Clothes&#x201D;). And I feel accomplished thinking that I may have coined theconcepts of &#x201C;Technical Yield&#x201D; and purposefully &#x201C;Blowing up Scope.&#x201D;</p><p>Blogging has enriched my professional life, and although I sometimes havedoubts about its purpose, I don&#x2019;t want to miss having my blog anymore. It&#x2019;sbecome almost like an investment in myself and I&#x2019;ve managed to cash out on someof its benefits. That&#x2019;s great and so for 2022 and beyond, I hope to grow andget better acquainted with my audience too. This blog may grow.</p><p>Uniquely, writing is my second favorite creative process I&#x2019;ve learned to enjoybesides coding. In fact, some days it&#x2019;s my favorite. So above all, being ableto express me and my ideas through language, it being code, English, or German</p><ul><li>I&#x2019;ve come to realize as my biggest privilege. I love working with language,and so in the future, I&#x2019;d be grateful to have the chance to expand my knowledgeon this topic further.</li></ul><p>To all my companions, I&#x2019;m grateful to enjoy your company!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(Originially posted on<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/r9d9gf/illuminating_the_dark_forest/">/r/ethereum</a>)</em></p><p>We&#x2019;ve now been in the bull market for so long that I believe the referenceframe for what many of us initially came to crypto for is starting to beforgotten.</p><p>Today, besides angry gas fee posts, what really seems to be popping isborderline-legal DAO meme projects that promise wildly seductive APY numbers(&#x201C;7000% APY&#x201D;), while the reality is that many of those projects are outrightillegal and immoral Ponzi schemes with great web design though.</p><p>Seeing all those huge green numbers on a daily basis, it&#x2019;s easy to sometimesforget why we joined the space in the first place: to build betterorganizations and to update the internet!</p><p>As a case in point, OlympusDAO:</p><p>By visiting its website, it&#x2019;s almost hard to believe: but a project like themuch-hyped OlympusDAO registered their domain just months ago, on 2021-03-27,and so I find it kind of difficult to understand if the project and its membershave the required long-term commitment to make meaningful contributions to thespace [5]. Especially because innovating in the space has historically onlyworked through grinding the bleeding edge for multiple years at a time. I don&#x2019;tdoubt the integrity of the OlympusDAO&#x2019;s founders. But that&#x2019;s because I simplydon&#x2019;t know them!</p><p>How do I know that meaningful contribution only comes through long-termcommitment? I&#x2019;ve been a founding member of <a href="http://ascribe.io">ascribe.io</a> and the Ocean Protocol,and they&#x2019;ve been shipping for 6 years straight now to get to where they&#x2019;retoday: on CMC #130 [2]! The classic ten years to an overnight success story.</p><p>But more simply put, the point I&#x2019;m trying to make here is that the provenancemechanism we&#x2019;re so proud of in the NFT space has started to become broken inthe web3 startup space!</p><p>Even for a seasoned developer, it&#x2019;s become harder and harder to understand whatare good projects and who are those that are just in for the quick money orpulling the rug [3, 9].</p><p>The provenance of crypto startups has become unclear as, given regulatorypressure, many startup founders have chosen to launch anonymously. It&#x2019;s coolbecause it means that many traditionally discriminated people can now launch aproject without facing unnecessary scrutiny or glass ceilings. It&#x2019;s bad becausewe have no reference point anymore for who&#x2019;s done good in the past and who&#x2019;sdone bad. Today, how can we know? And as users, how can we protect ourselvesand our investments?</p><p>At the same time, the security incidents plaguing smart contracts have becomefrequent pop-cultural events; We don&#x2019;t even take them seriously anymore.They&#x2019;ve become entertainment as rekt.news existence proves [4]. It&#x2019;s as if wecan&#x2019;t wait to hear about the latest hacked developers and the background story:But cloaked behind these seemingly unspectacular security incidents hides amuch bigger crisis! It&#x2019;s that web3 has become a DARK and DANGEROUS place!  In2020, D. Robinson and G. Konstantopoulos write: &#x201C;Ethereum is a dark forest.&#x201D;[1].</p><p>In the authors&#x2019; own words, Ethereum&#x2019;s story has become &#x201C;a horror story.&#x201D; It isabout a dystopian, adversarial, and unlawful place where everyone just banks onthe weakness of their peers for their personal profit. &#x201C;An environment in whichdetection means certain death at the hands of advanced predators&#x201D; [1].</p><p>Through those eyes that seem to see today&#x2019;s reality more clearly than our naiveweb2 goggles, all web3 products ought to be at first observed with caution.What are the true motivations that guide some DAO&#x2019;s masterminds? Are they hereto change the world for the better? Or are they merely attempting an elaboratecoup for their personal enrichment?</p><p>The problem in today&#x2019;s space is that WE CANNOT KNOW! The infrastructure fordocumenting and fighting scams simply isn&#x2019;t there. We&#x2019;re not capable ofresolving disputes, but even worse: We&#x2019;re not even properly documenting what&#x2019;shappening. My biggest fear is that if the crypto space continues to fail toregulate itself: Inherently, we&#x2019;ll have to be regulated &#x2026; by you know whom!</p><p>The most we do t0day, is that we reside to document scams on, e.g., Redditthrough &#x201C;lists of rug pulls&#x201D; [6]. I guess we&#x2019;re also trying to warn our peersin DMs, and for particularly bad cases, we sometimes speak up publicly.</p><p>But most attacks on all our hard-earned money aren&#x2019;t &#x201C;security&#x201D; incidents as itis, e.g., framed by rekt.news.</p><p>Sure, these events are disguised as broken contracts and flawedimplementations: But the reality is that all those hackers causing them endedup taking the calculated risk of stealing money from users as coin mixingallows them to anonymously exit their profits, e.g., through tornado.cash [7].</p><p>So while it looks as though the situation is under control throughever-improving static analysis tools and more frequent security audits, theproblem isn&#x2019;t directly about building flawless smart contracts but much moreabout the integrity of project founders! The web3 community has a safety crisisand flawed smart contract security is merely a side effect.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because the web3 space that prouds itself with its friendliness towardsanonymous project founders has created a system so immune to proper provenancethat it stops becoming humanly possible to do proper due diligence beforecommitting funds. Even as a long-term member of the space, it&#x2019;s become toughknowing the wheat from the chaff!</p><p>A path out of the dark forest, or at least towards finding a guiding light thatcould illuminate it, lies, in my opinion, in improving the current provenancesystem through algorithmically-aided positive reinforcement and betterdocumentation. We need to strengthen our capacity to do due diligencecollectively.</p><p>To learn from our mistakes and the space&#x2019;s most flawed projects, I think it isup to all of us to make a change!</p><p>We have to start documenting shady behavior not only when it&#x2019;s too late. Weshould hold adversarial founders accountable not only after they&#x2019;ve committedimmoral action - but throughout their entire rise to fame.</p><p>Finally, we&#x2019;re now in a time where data can truly be available for extendedperiods of time and where we&#x2019;re capable of easily verifying its integrity. It&#x2019;sa chance for us to build better infrastructure for documenting what ishappening, annotating documents, and exposing troublesome information.</p><p>Using on-chain data, we can now rate a project&#x2019;s health in real-time andpotentially provide relative safety scores. Dispute resolution protocols likeKleros and others may potentially even allow us to resolve confliects withinweb3 - without ever having to surface into the world of atoms [8].</p><p>We have the tools to illuminate the dark forest and make it a safe place foreveryone. But it&#x2019;s on us to work in making that change happen! To illuminatethe dark forest.</p><h2 id="References">References</h2><ol><li><a href="https://medium.com/@danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff">https://medium.com/(at)danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff/</a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ocean-protocol/">https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ocean-protocol/</a></li><li><a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/11/30/original-observations-about-todays-crypto-bull-market/">https://timdaub.github.io/2021/11/30/original-observations-about-todays-crypto-bull-market/</a></li><li><a href="https://rekt.news/">https://rekt.news/</a></li><li><a href="https://who.is/whois/olympusdao.finance">https://who.is/whois/olympusdao.finance</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pztg86/an_extensive_list_of_rug_pulls_committed_by/">https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pztg86/an_extensive_list_of_rug_pulls_committed_by/</a></li><li><a href="https://tornado.cash/">https://tornado.cash/</a></li><li><a href="https://kleros.io/">https://kleros.io/</a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/rug-pull">https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/rug-pull</a></li></ol>]]></content>

But actually, I wannakeep this short and focused. I just want to journal the observations of thesedays&#x2019; market sentiment for posterity.</p><p>The following are original observations of the cryptosphere in the today&#x2019;s&#x201C;late-stage&#x201D; bull market. They&#x2019;re original, as they significantly differ fromthe observations I made in, e.g., the last late-stage bull market in crypto in2018. By no means is this list exhaustive:</p><ul><li>The bull market has lasted so long that certain bullshit qualities andbehavior now managed to persist into the sphere&#x2019;s &#x201C;culture&#x201D; without marketparticipants being aware. Whole projects are founded on hot air but faithfulin their belief that the hype train will eventually come to pick them up.</li><li>External spectators, e.g., commentators of Hacker News, have stopped beingcapable of differentiating between the space&#x2019;s former quality projects andtoday&#x2019;s bullshit. They (rightfully?) equate all of crypto to a big scam orponzi, and their tone has turned particularly aggressive and unforgiving.</li><li>Genuine present-day innovation is being undervalued compared to speculativefuture results. I have colleagues complain that all their community wants istokens when, in fact, they&#x2019;re shipping game-changing innovation.</li><li>Some of the space&#x2019;s newcomers that I meet are so deluded and confused thatany non-hype-based narrative slips past them. Will there be a lost generationof crypto devs?</li><li>Generally, any non-hype-based and crypto-mainstream-leaning idea gets leftunnoticed while repeating the 0815-formula gets particular wide-rangingpraise. Does your project even exist without launching an ERC20 token?</li><li>A degree of thought-synchronization has taken place that discriminatesoriginality and evangelizes <em>the one way of doing things.</em></li><li>Numerous long-standing contributors that I have known to be true believersover many years have started turning sour and cynical. Some have becomeopenly and/or cloaked opponents/critics.</li><li>For everyone, including experts in the field, it continues to become morechallenging to separate noise from signal.</li><li>It has become ludicrously easy to raise money with no strings attached tobuild any type of software. It&#x2019;s great, but it doesn&#x2019;t feel real.</li></ul><p>And that&#x2019;s all. I hope you can appreciate this different type of blogging too.</p>]]></content>

It starts by excusing yourself on the group chat for &#x201C;having notime to join,&#x201D; only to later realize that you must have missed out ON THESOCIAL HAPPENING OF THE MONTH when checking their awesome pictures, snaps andstories.</p><p>It seems that in 2021, we should know better, though. I&#x2019;ve described theunderlying phenomenon in another one of my posts and titled it <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/07/21/nfts-are-coming-for-instagram/">&#x201C;NFTs arecoming for Instagram and other social mediaplatforms&#x201D;</a>.</p><p>The post tells the story of how we distort our realities with social mediausage and that our yacht-boarding idols; Maybe they&#x2019;re not so glamorous afterall. Maybe, besides their many followers, all they truly have is the knowledgeof how to look amazing online.</p><p>And so, I think acknowledging this type of contemporary social flexing, weshould manage to identify FOMO-induced urgency during the crypto bull markettoo.</p><h2 id="Urgency-is-FOMO-And-FOMO-isn&#x2019;t-a-good-decision-making-criteria">Urgency is FOMO; And FOMO isn&#x2019;t a good decision-making criteria.</h2><p>Yes, really, urgency is a more defined version of anxiety or <em>fear of missingout</em>. It promotes the infamous &#x2018;ape-ing&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s the natural signal of our bodytelling us that our lives are threatened because we&#x2019;re about to miss out. Ourbrains scream: &#x201C;Hey! LOOK THERE! Others are feasting on some delicious berriesor whatever! GET IN THERE NOOOOW!&#x201D;</p><p>And so, the natural reaction is to do exactly that. FOMO, it&#x2019;s the reason we hadno toilet paper in the beginning of 2020. It&#x2019;s sadly also of existential matterto the functioning of the crypto bull market.</p><p>Personally, I&#x2019;ve learned in my career, though, that acting on emotions isn&#x2019;talways a good choice to make quality decisions. Indeed, I noticed that the lessirrational and the more grounded in reality I made past decisions, the higherquality they ended up being over the long run.</p><h2 id="&#x201C;First-mover-advantage&#x201D;">&#x201C;First-mover advantage&#x201D;</h2><p>In venture capital, they&#x2019;ve even managed to name the concept. If you&#x2019;re intotheir type of talk, you might know that sometimes they talk about &#x201C;First- andlast-mover advantages.&#x201D;</p><p>Their stories? That Facebook and Google only became successful for building therespective &#x201C;last&#x201D; search engine and social network.</p><p>Legend has it that Larry and Sergey discovered their edge in the market bybeing &#x201C;late to the party&#x201D; and fixing search engines&#x2019; low-quality results byimproving &#x201C;10x&#x201D; upon the problem by inventing PageRank.</p><p>Sure, Yahoo and AlterVista were also interested in high-quality results. But bybeing so much better, Google simply made them irrelevant.</p><h2 id="Crypto&#x2019;s-First-Movers">Crypto&#x2019;s First Movers</h2><p>As a long-time lurker, I think similar things have already happened in thecryptosphere too. Case in point: Those popular in crypto weren&#x2019;t its firstmovers.</p><p>Actually, many of the space&#x2019;s former figureheads, its &#x201C;first-movers,&#x201D; havefailed to retain relative relevancy, in my opinion. It&#x2019;d be a bit mean to namesome here, but I invite you to trust my argument.</p><p>Those that are at the space&#x2019;s top today aren&#x2019;t those that were impactful backthen. Indeed, today&#x2019;s crypto celebs seem to have emerged only recently. Andthat makes sense, too, given that DeFi, for example, is a very emergent subfield.</p><p>Back in 2016 and earlier, my impression today is that crypto was rathergoverned by &#x201C;weirdos&#x201D; living on tight spectrums. Funnily enough, some of thesphere&#x2019;s most (in)famous are now dead, in jail or have moved on entirely.  I&#x2019;vewritten about that idea before too, it&#x2019;s what I tried to say with <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">&#x201C;Ethereumisn&#x2019;t funanymore.&#x201D;</a></p><h2 id="About-the-Urgency-of-building-Web3">About the Urgency of building Web3</h2><p>So then, is it necessary to act on our urgency when building web3? Is it worthprioritizing shipping above anything else? Personal well-being? Quality?Values?</p><p>I&#x2019;d say no.</p><p>In my opinion, the hearts and minds of any industry are won by deliberatelong-term commitment and continuous meaningful contributions.</p><p>Doesn&#x2019;t success come down to trust built between people? And doesn&#x2019;t that takelots of time?</p><p>I believe so, and that&#x2019;s why I want to reject the notion of urgency. I want toreject the idea that today is a more unique time to start something new thanany other day. I want to believe that today is as good of a time to startsomething new as any other day.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s why I think there&#x2019;s no urgency in building web3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#x201C;The Metaverse,&#x201D; everybody&#x2019;s new favorite tech vision after &#x201C;the Singularity,&#x201D;has recently had its inflection moment when Zuck decided to rename his shittywebsite from Facebook to &#x201C;Meta&#x201D;.</p><p>First of all, thanks, Mark, for ruining another word - but secondly: Can westop talking about it? <a href="https://outline.com/DUdr8Y">The Metaverse is bullshit, it&#x2019;s called theinternet</a>. Also, <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/the-metaverse-is-already-here-its-minecraft-99c89ed8ba2">it&#x2019;s already here and called&#x201C;Minecraft.&#x201D;</a></p><p>And while I think that we should anyways move on from the term &#x201C;Metaverse&#x201D; tosomething more positively co-notated (no, I haven&#x2019;t read Snowcrash) andoriginal; to help further the rationale that &#x201C;the Metaverse is bullshit&#x201D; - I&#x2019;dlike to highlight another aspect of that story today: I think a corporationlike Facebook isn&#x2019;t able to create a parallel universe anyway.</p><p>See, I think that Zuck et al. already done goofed when they confidentlyproclaimed to be the Metaverse&#x2019;s creators in their recent keynote announcement.What it shows is that they have a false sense of confidence about knowing whatpeople want and their capabilities.</p><p>Can Facebook create a parallel universe everyone is comfortable in?  Is theMetaverse&#x2019;s scope not too big for a single company to create?</p><p>As a software developer, I stare at screens for many hours of my day. And I&#x2019;vecome to realize that actively limiting my on-screen time is good. I&#x2019;veconcluded that staring at screens isn&#x2019;t serving me too well over a longerperiod of time.</p><p>It has to do with lots of physical constraints - namely, that my body slowlyadjusts to sitting in a chair all day and all that jazz. For example, I getback and shoulder pain. But also: What happens on my screens contributes to mymental health status too.</p><p>When I feel constrained, belittled, or misunderstood by the computer; I getangry, anxious and generally, my mood worsens.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve come to realize that those emotions are evoked particularly at certaintimes and only with certain software. Sure, having the agency to perceive theworld as I want, I&#x2019;ve still come to appreciate the principles of pioneers likethe Free Software Foundation. I quote from the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">gnuwebsite</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Free software means users have the four essential freedoms: (0) to run theprogram, (1) to study and change the program in source code form, (2) toredistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions.</p></blockquote><p>People, dogmatic about the principles of the FSF are often belittled in thesoftware development community. Like, for example, recently, when on a panelasked about open-sourcing the Teslabot&#x2019;s software, Elon Musk snarkily remarkedthat (I&#x2019;m paraphrasing): &#x201C;Yeah, but we can&#x2019;t make it open-source as peopleshould pay for it [the Teslabot].&#x201D;</p><p>It&#x2019;s the classical dilemma. Either you are open-source, or you&#x2019;re making stacksof cash.</p><p>But what&#x2019;s also important to highlight is that I think generally speaking, auser&#x2019;s happiness is so much higher when they can afford to use awell-maintained program that is &#x201C;free as in libre.&#x201D;</p><p>The freedom of expression that a piece of open-source software gives me over aSaaS or a tightly-controlled binary is so much greater. I can file bug reports,I can influence the program&#x2019;s roadmap - I can even implement features.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no limit to the customizability of the program.  I can make it do whatI want.  I can inspect it. But most importantly, if I want to, I can be incontrol.</p><p>For free software, mostly, there&#x2019;s no gatekeeping about the future either:&#x201C;Everything goes&#x201D; as long as contributors agree on &#x201C;how things are done.&#x201D; Andthe question of &#x201C;what to do?&#x201D; is often subject to spontaneous and roughconsensus between contributors.</p><p>On the other hand, commerical or proprietary software always follows <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">deonticideals</a>.Its existence is informed by the motive to extract rent. Here, we code becausewe need to make a living. That isn&#x2019;t reprehensible; but logically, as rentextraction is the sole purpose for existence and future perspective; aproprietary software&#x2019;s development concentrates on the conservation of thatattribute.</p><p>So a process as Facebook has it, geared towards generating proprietarysoftware, I believe, cannot achieve creating an all-encompassing parallel anddigital universe because it simply won&#x2019;t achieve reflection of all users&#x2019;desires. Simply put, it won&#x2019;t be able to create the <em>actual</em> Metaverse as itscorporate communication structure won&#x2019;t be capable of do so. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&#x2019;slaw</a>, everybody.</p><p>Probably, with the help of the likes of McKinsey &amp; Company, Facebook will beable to create something that people want: But long-term, that won&#x2019;t be whatwe&#x2019;re longing for.</p><p>What we&#x2019;re longing for can only be created through a principled, democratic,free and open approach many sometimes call &#x201C;chaotic.&#x201D; The free software andopen source community.</p><p>In a way, the Metaverse is long here, and we&#x2019;ve all been consumed by it. It&#x2019;severything that we do on our computers already. It&#x2019;s the internet, it&#x2019;sprograms, it&#x2019;s Minecraft and it&#x2019;s the memes and stories we tell each other.</p><p>Sorry Zuck, we don&#x2019;t need you for that.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Tokens considered harmful</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2017 I boarded a special plane. My second flight to New York City withLufthansa from Berlin Tegel Airport via Frankfurt to Newark Airport. It wasjust hours before that year&#x2019;s Consensus conference in Time Square&#x2019;s MarriottMarquis would take place and as the product manager of BigchainDB, I had noidea what I had gotten myself into.</p><p>I landed real &#x201C;poor but sexy&#x201D; by boarding a direct bus shuttle to Manhattanfrom Newark. And then what followed were a few days of total craziness.</p><p>Already at seven in the morning of the show&#x2019;s first day, our booth got drownedin visitors. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re crazy!&#x201D; was all my colleague had to contribute to thecrowd&#x2019;s engagement.</p><p>And soon a personal problem I couldn&#x2019;t have anticipated was the fragility of myvoice becoming softer as it started fading from the constant screaming-level Ihad to retain by communicating on the Marriott&#x2019;s trade floor.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/uasf.jpeg" alt="UASF (long: &quot;user activated soft fork&quot;)"></p><p>I remember these days as specially weird. Particularly, finding myself in anelevator full of UASF-wearing Bitcoin maxis, or to be entangled in rathercasual conversations with Bushwick&#x2019;s nouveau rich.</p><p>Also, there&#x2019;s this party night on a skyscraper&#x2019;s rooftop. And some dialogues:</p><p><strong>I asked him</strong> what he does for a living, and he answered that he worked forthe people throwing the party.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, really? And what do you do?&#x201D;; I followed up.</p><p>&#x201C;I work for EOS!&#x201D; he claimed.</p><p>&#x201C;EOS?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yeah, EOS, the Ethereum killer.&#x201D;</p><p>Another memory is later, when she pointed to a guy and said: &#x201C;That&#x2019;s him,that&#x2019;s the DAO hacker!&#x201D;</p><p>Most of it, just blurry memories today.</p><p>But what truly happened during those days was the discovery of the cryptospherenew favorite toy: <em>tokens</em>. All the summer, they had been the rage. They wereconfirmed through Bitcoin&#x2019;s steady climb and cemented in to history those daysEthereum&#x2019;s price simply started exploding.</p><p>Tokens, they called them, and suddenly everything looked like a nail. It did tome too. And it was hard to get at first.</p><p>&#x201C;What to make of them?&#x201D; I thought. &#x201C;Tokens? Coins? And for what?&#x201D; Those days,my mind got stuck finding parallels to Bitcoin. Those days it startedwandering. &#x201C;So, if we want to have tokens for another project but Bitcoin:Wouldn&#x2019;t it mean that we&#x2019;d either have to repurpose the Proof of Work algorithmor invent another utility delivering algorithm?&#x201D;</p><p>Months later, I found myself trying to model a utility token. It just seemedlogical: I was an engineer, and here was a tool that could help me to engineermore.</p><p>But it came different than I expected.</p><p>Given how galvanized we were, we pivoted the company. But contrary to myexpectations, we didn&#x2019;t start designing our software to encompass tokens. Infact, noone else did either.</p><p>I started looking around, and all I saw were tokens. Tokens tokens tokens.Every investor wanted them; many tech people seemed cool with them too. So whatcould be wrong?</p><p>But nobody really got what we were supposed to do with them. Sure, there wereoccasionally brilliant moments that led to interesting designs. Case in point,TCRs (long: &#x201C;token curated registries&#x201D;). But even after months, everything hadremained how I had initially observed it.</p><p>A token&#x2019;s first principle existence wasn&#x2019;t meant to exponentiate engineering.Instead, I and others found myself observing waves of VCs pushing fortokenization with seemingly no reason but to collect funds. Suddenly, what Ithought of as an engineer&#x2019;s tool became a framework for flipping wealth frompoor to rich overnight.</p><p>&#x201C;Just launch a token; use our SAFT. 10 easy steps to ICO.&#x201D;</p><p>I tried going along with it. After all, what could be so bad? But the duststirred up those days didn&#x2019;t settle, and tokens didn&#x2019;t end up making sense. Imean, they did: But only in a very narrow engineering sense. Super toughengineering, designing utility machines. A concept business-types weren&#x2019;tinterested in or capable of seeing at the time. Maybe not capable of seeingtoday.</p><p>And so, when I saw that we put the token before the product: I quit.</p><hr><p>In 2021, most tokens are still speculative nonsense. Most companies launch atoken and then try to build a product - many fail to build a product. Many failto incorporate their token in a meaningful way. Don&#x2019;t be those companies.</p><p>Think rationally and resist forced tokenization. Take a critical stance.</p><p>Think logically, remove your ego and most importantly: don&#x2019;t let your capital(desires) influence your engineering decisions. Code is speech and you arecapable of more than just increasing your personal wealth.</p><p>Also: Your token doesn&#x2019;t have utility just because you say so.</p><p>You can be braver. Just build what needs building and ignore the bs.</p><p>Do what&#x2019;s good and reasonable - for everyone. And not only for those that holdthe token.</p><p>Because tokens in software design considered harmful.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/images/emperor.jpg"><p>I&#x2019;ll cut right to the chase: I believe a big reason why many people in thisworld suffer is because some other people can afford to decide irrationally.</p><p>In &#x201C;Was ist Autorit&#xE4;t?&#x201D; (en.: &#x201C;What is authority?&#x201D;) Bochenski, the author,divides authority into two distinct categories.  Authority, he claims, is arelationship between e.g. two parties and a domain, where one partyacknowledges the authority of another over the domain.</p><p>However, Bechenski makes a remarkable categorization of authorities within thebook. He generally divides authority into <em>epistemic</em> and <em>deontic</em> andspecifies that:</p><ul><li>an <em>epistemic</em> authority (= &#x201C;relating to knowledge&#x201D;) says it &#x201C;<em>how it is</em>&#x201D;;whereas</li><li>a <em>deontic</em> authority (= &quot;relating to duty and obligation) says it &#x201C;<em>how itshould be</em>&#x201D;.</li></ul><p>I find these categories remarkable as they also help to get a clearer picturewhen, for example, working with software. I&#x2019;d go even further and say that manyconflicts in developing software stem from denying or being unaware of thispower dynamic.</p><p>If, for example, you browse blog posts on Hacker News, then you&#x2019;ll often comeacross the type of developer that hates meetings and their manager. Thebrisance in the relationship to their manager, I&#x2019;ve come to observe, oftenstems from failing to differentiate between <em>epistemic</em> and <em>deontic</em>authority.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because generally, the developer bases their arguments on &#x201C;<em>how thingsare</em>&#x201D;, whereas the manager is commissioned to make things &#x201C;<em>how they shouldbe</em>&#x201D;.  Put more simply, the developer is an epistemic authority to the manager,but the manager is a deontic authority to the developer.</p><p>And while you might think that, hence, there shouldn&#x2019;t be a problem as surelythings between devs and managers will balance out over time, acknowledging theanecdotal reality is that I&#x2019;ve never read an angry manager&#x2019;s blog.</p><p>So I&#x2019;d argue that the reason I&#x2019;ve never seen a manager&#x2019;s mad blog is that they,being the deontic authority, always get their way by being also in control ofthe project&#x2019;s funds and hence the dev. So even though things &#x201C;<em>are</em>&#x201D;, they&#x2019;remade as they &#x201C;<em>should</em>&#x201D;.</p><h2 id="On-chain-the-Emperor-wears-no-Clothes">On-chain, the Emperor wears no Clothes</h2><p>Now, to deliver on this article&#x2019;s headline, which reads why &#x201C;on-chain, theemperor wears no clothes,&#x201D; I think it&#x2019;s of vital importance to understand thedifference in the types of authorities. It&#x2019;s because in the colorful world ofERC20s, who controls the token, controls the money and hence puts themselvesinto the deontic authority position towards others.</p><p>Suddenly, things can&#x2019;t be done in a rational way anymore: The &#x201C;<em>how it is</em>&#x201D;stops being acknowledged. The &#x201C;<em>how it should be</em>&#x201D; becomes more relevant.  Andthat&#x2019;s where, in my opinion, the suffering for epistemic authorities starts.</p><h2 id="Authorative-Development">Authorative Development</h2><p>It is my conviction any type of software we use today is based on epistemologyand not deontology. It&#x2019;s because deontology can&#x2019;t inform epistemology.</p><p>It may be concluded that indeed the world is better should 2 + 1 = 4, butdeontology doesn&#x2019;t carry the same power as reason and epistemology. Deontologycan only be accomplished through force and continuous preaching.</p><p>Epistemology, on the other hand, appears in humans beings as a fundamentalfeeling. In a way, it could be seen as the most powerful appliance of empathy.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because if we explain math to someone and succeed in making themunderstand, then through this act of understanding, we transferred knowledge.We haven&#x2019;t had to use force. We didn&#x2019;t need to preach. The person comprehendedthe knowledge through the feeling of discovery. That person, taughtepistemically, can now go out in the world and start teaching others.</p><p>With deontic reasoning, on the other hand, we can&#x2019;t gain this level ofsustainability. To enforce the &#x201C;<em>should</em>&#x201D;, we&#x2019;ll have to stay in control andexercise power. If our student was to escape and roam the world, they may nowrun the risk of being exposed to knowledge. Then what?</p><p>Well eventually, I&#x2019;d argue, that knowledge and &#x201C;<em>what is</em>&#x201D; would startoverwriting the forcefully fed &#x201C;<em>should</em>&#x201D;. One day, all preachings would begone and worst of all, our student wouldn&#x2019;t be able to transfer any of the&#x201C;<em>should</em>&#x201D;.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past, when the crypto space had been in a bubble, during my times oncrypto Twitter (short: &#x201C;CT&#x201D;), one popularly debated question had always beenthat about &#x201C;inflated expectations.&#x201D; The classic Gartner hype cycle chart informswhere the debate stems from.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/hypecycle.png" alt="Gartner Hypecycle Curve with Annotations"></p><p>The line of thinking is this: If indeed, we can rationally prove that thereare inflated expectations towards the bubbling technology market, then we canconclude being in a bubble and adjust our financial bets.</p><p>On CT in 2018, this led to many long nights of productive debates andeventually, the masses indeed reached a conclusion: blockchain technologywasn&#x2019;t ready for prime time yet. And so what followed was a meteoric perioddubbed the &#x201C;crypto winter&#x201D;, a time and environment where only the strongestsaplings ended up thriving in what became known as the &#x201C;DeFi summer.&#x201D;</p><p>And while it was fairly regular seeing anime-avatared accounts makingimpressively reasonable contributions to the cryptocurrency space, what hadn&#x2019;tbeen the case yet was animes founding top projects.</p><p>The whole space fit some arbitrary city&#x2019;s convention center and peoplegenuinely knew each other beyond just the awkward conference small talk.Getting accustomed to the Ethereum community in 2018 almost felt likebecoming part of a big clique or family. These bonds, I believe, are what madeit so successful as we came for the smart contracts - but stayed for thefam.</p><p>However, during DeFi summer and with the space&#x2019;s insane growth, that socialdynamic changed. Not intentionally and for sure quite gradually, but it did.The relevancy of anime-anons grew and with that also their project&#x2019;ssignificance. Practically overnight, (hostile?) forks like SushiSwap - foundedand maintained by anons - emerged as real threats to their clear-namedcounterpart: Uniswap.</p><p>Albeit its impact being controversially discussed, rumor had it that to counterSushi, Uniswap, merely as a damage-controlling measure, launched its owngovernance token UNI. And today?</p><p>The space&#x2019;s state is that SushiSwap - a project without any traditionalbusiness foundation - generating weekly revenues of $1M through transaction feecollection; still consists of few with clear-named appearance while, in themeantime, its compliant older brother, Uniswap, found itself recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-sec-investigates-crypto-exchange-developer-uniswap-labs-wsj-2021-09-03/">becomingunderscrutiny</a>by the world&#x2019;s most powerful financial regulator: The United States Securityand Exchange Commission.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s the point where I believe we must backtrack and ask ourselves thedelicate question posed at this article&#x2019;s beginning; bubbles and <em>inflatedexpectations</em>.</p><p>If tokenization and compliance is indeed a commercial detriment that leads topersecution and not tolerance, then won&#x2019;t we see the trend of crypto project<strong>anonymization</strong> accelerate? Or, instead, will we all - with the help of ourlord and savior, the constitutional state - be guided towards the light andrealize that the best bet to freedom and peace is <strong>detokenization</strong>?</p><p>Being a crypto company founder (<a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>)with an active clear-name avatar myself; my thoughts are this: Though I&#x2019;mhugely in favor of secularizing the relationship of state and currency control,I concede to the idea that large parts of the world should remain under theauthority of <em>a</em> state.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think it has ever been crypto&#x2019;s aspiration to legislate atom space.Counter to that; it has actually continued to expand cyberspace into a nowfully-functioning parallelized digital economy that was originally bootstrappedby Bitcoin and the likes. There&#x2019;s a reason that &#x201C;you don&#x2019;t need a blockchain&#x201D;in &#x201C;real-life&#x201D; applications. It&#x2019;s because blockchain wasn&#x2019;t and isn&#x2019;t built for&#x201C;real&#x201D;; It&#x2019;s <em>cyber</em>.</p><p>Then, thinking conceptually about this parallel economy, I think the state isright to have some entitlement about controlling the space&#x2019;s borders. Andlogically, it&#x2019;s why today we pay tax when selling crypto to fiat.  However, Ido feel that the state has started falsely taking responsibility when itstarted regulating what it cannot control.</p><p>On countless websites of countless states, the message is clear: Be prepared tolose it all when investing your money in crypto. Hence, how can then also exista mandate to regulate the &#x201C;illegal&#x201D; issuance of &#x201C;securities&#x201D; when indeed thereality is that ERC20 tokens are being issued on Ethereum, a globallydistributed ledger?</p><p>Couldn&#x2019;t we consider a nation-state &#x201C;illegally leaving its sovereign territory&#x201D;if it started policing a globally distributed project in cyberspace? Sure, thecounterargument would be that the internet is a collection of routers, switchesand cables controlled by yours truly; But to me, that&#x2019;s neither a technicalrequirement anymore nor is it informing the question of policing.  Wouldn&#x2019;te.g., the US literally overstep borders if it started policing a globallydistributed crypto project?</p><p>As a founder in the space, these questions are indeed of<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/05/22/ethereum-layer2-scaling-rollups-dapps-sidechains/">existential</a>matter. How <em>must</em> one behave in the face of these developments?</p><p>I, too, have had countless anonymous accounts and even launched minor projectswith them. But have I been excited about them? Not that much. See, I didn&#x2019;twant and I still don&#x2019;t want to take the legal risk of anonymously contributingto DeFi. Neither do I want to physically move to a crypto-friendly jurisdictioneither.</p><p>Ironically, on a technical level, I&#x2019;d be capable of doing what the space&#x2019;s mostsuccessful are doing, but I&#x2019;m hesitant about getting my hands dirty.</p><p>With my clear-named startup <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>, Ican&#x2019;t legally launch tokens in Germany; I mean, I could - but it&#x2019;d be socapital and time-intensive that there wouldn&#x2019;t be a point. As an anon, I&#x2019;d becapable - but could I make a living from crypto alone without becoming part ofa parallel society? And don&#x2019;t I strive for recognition too?</p><p>So then, doesn&#x2019;t the original question framed at the beginning remain? Is thecryptocurrency market&#x2019;s evaluation subject to inflated expectations?</p><p>If crypto and DeFi are truly that great for innovation now, isn&#x2019;t it kind ofironic that after nine months of work, I&#x2019;m starting to realize that myproject&#x2019;s challenges don&#x2019;t lie within technology but are made of legaluncertainty?</p><p>Call me attached to my meaty identity, but I&#x2019;d rather <em>detokenize</em> than<em>anonymize</em>.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In software engineering, when there&#x2019;s a lack of budget or time, we do thingsimproperly. I&#x2019;d argue that for most code I&#x2019;ve written, there&#x2019;s a hidden idealof that code failing to come to fruition. Objectively speaking, any code canhardly be ideal. As there&#x2019;s no universally aesthetic poem or an infinitelyfunny joke (except in the Monty Python universe), so is there nohyper-functional piece of code.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBWr1KtnRcI" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Funnily enough, we engineers, hence, say that when code passes from developmentinto production that it has become &#x201C;<em>legacy</em>.&#x201D; Legacy, herein, is being used as asynonym for the financial term of liability.</p><p>Legacy code is problematic as it can slow us down in the present, as it canforcefully direct budgets towards maintenance and since its structure mandateswhat is and possibly can be.</p><p>But when, during development, we take deliberate shortcuts to pump code intoproduction with more velocity, then this type of behavior may later qualify as<em>incurring technical debt</em>.</p><p>Having had no professional background in any financial domain, as a juniorsoftware engineer, I liked to talk about technical debt as exactly describedabove. I&#x2019;d think that a bad piece of code that requires maintenance symbolizestechnical debt. Never did I dive into the epistemic definition of the term:<strong>debt</strong>. Why would I - debt had never been a relatable topic of mine.</p><p>But more recently, by taking on more financial work through building<a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>, I&#x2019;ve come to realize thepowerfulness of painting the full picture that is <em>technical debt</em>. On my walkhere, it came to my mind that for technical debt to incur, the <em>borrower</em> mustengage in a deliberate process of <em>collateralizing a piece of<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/06/18/when-scope-blows-up/">scope</a></em>.</p><p>In practical terms, what this may mean is that, e.g., a software engineerneglects unit testing their code. Considering that unit tests increaseconfidence about a software&#x2019;s correction after changes occur, now suddenly theSE (or borrower) traded in future confidence for improved short-term progress.If suddenly no testing is required, adjusting a small piece of software isquicker and cheaper to send into production.</p><p>However, the catch is that now their debt position starts accumulating<em>negative interest</em>. In case a month later, the engineer wants to make anotherchange to the code, it now means that adjusting it already became more complex.Since no tests are available and because their memories about the code&#x2019;sfunctionality have faded, how can the engineer ship the adjusted code intoproduction with confidence?</p><p>They can&#x2019;t. And the most damning part is that at this stage, many engineersfold, accept their fate and start incurring even more debt.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/debt-spiral-sausage.jpg" alt="When I googled &quot;debt spiral&quot;, this royalty free image of a sausage came up."></p><p>And that&#x2019;s the ingenuity I found when thinking about technical debt. Not onlyis it a synonym for a piece of code that is bad. Rather it&#x2019;s a term to expressthat a few lines may carry huge liabilities for whoever has takenresponsibility to maintain them. It&#x2019;s really debt, in the financial sense.Except that its deleveraging will take place through various proxies.</p><p>But the real reason I sat down to write this blog post wasn&#x2019;t because oftechnical debt. But because, logically, when there&#x2019;s debt - <strong>there also has tobe technical interest or yield</strong>.</p><p>So in a way, it&#x2019;s funny that many of us are constantly obsessed with continuousshipping, when instead, clearly, there&#x2019;s also <strong>yield</strong> to be harvested fromgreat engineering. And intuitively, I believe it exists. There&#x2019;s definitelythat one brilliant and well-oiled machine producing incredible yield for itsowner.</p><p>My mind wanders from the image of a combustion engine to the invention ofhigher-level programming languages and computers and to all the brilliantphysical and chemical breakthroughs that allowed us to engineer around many ofour life&#x2019;s inconveniences. I&#x2019;m thinking of the thousands of hours that planesare in the air without crashing much. The countless lifes that have been safedby airbags. Refrigerators, washing machines, light bulbs.</p><p>Initially, many things were likely produced, incurring technical debt. However,seeing the immaculacy of some engineered concepts: I can&#x2019;t think but believethat when there&#x2019;s technical debt, there&#x2019;s also the option for technical yield.</p><p>And so I hope through this rhetorical discovery, in the future, I&#x2019;ll code morethings properly to <strong>stack yield and not debt</strong>.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks for reading.

    <title>Intellectual Property Is Becoming Irrelevant</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img alt="Would you do it?" src="/assets/images/downloadacar.png" style="height: 15em;"><p>Or would you?</p><p>Experiencing another surge in NFT demand, we now logically seeall sorts of companies publishing their latest tech research on how to registerand trade intellectual property (short &#x201C;IP&#x201D;) on-chain. The main idea they allfollow is:</p><ul><li>Register or &#x201C;anchor&#x201D; an IP&#x2019;s manifestation on-chain. And then; through itsdistinct registration;</li><li>make it tradable as an NFT on platforms like <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>for speculation or consumption.</li></ul><p>If you&#x2019;re a reader of my blog - by now I think you&#x2019;ve gotten the hints that I&#x2019;mnot a believer. In my last post, I said that &#x201C;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/07/21/nfts-are-coming-for-instagram/">NFTs are coming forInstagram and other social mediaplatforms</a>&#x201D;and that their <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/">provenance can be tamperedwith</a>.I&#x2019;m tripling down. NFTs have nothing to do with the legal concept ofintellectual property. Putting IP on the blockchain is missing the point.Nobody needs that.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m discontent even further with the space&#x2019;s view on intellectual property.From a philosophical point of view mainly. Let me explain.</p><h3 id="Been-there-done-that">Been there, done that</h3><p>Five years ago, I co-authored a document on intellectual property licensing andblockchain. As this work ended up being published in the COALA working group,we called it the &#x201C;<a href="https://github.com/COALAIP/specs">COALA IP Specification</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>I&#x2019;ll spare you the long read and say: it&#x2019;s essentially a year&#x2019;s worth ofresearch on intellectual property licensing and how organizations manage todigitize it in data structures. The document ended up being a self-glorifiedand unfinished recommendation for how to most generically model data structuresthat encompass all sorts of legal concepts and how to store those onblockchain-ish systems.</p><p>Today, I&#x2019;d argue that the specification&#x2019;s value didn&#x2019;t lie in creating thedocument itself - albeit it now has over 100 stars on GitHub (lol). Instead, Ithink most valuable about the effort was accumulating the experience ofpromoting and writing about the concept. Here&#x2019;s why:</p><p>The specification itself just tries to piece together a data model from, at thetime, commonly appreciated frameworks. Many of us were into ontologies andlinked data. It&#x2019;s why the spec is heavily reliant on <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>, JSON LinkedData, and other &#x201C;promising&#x201D; technologies that ended up nowhere.However, it defined two concepts that have become widely adopted indecentralized apps:</p><ul><li>The anchoring of data to prove its existence at a specific moment in time.</li><li>The mapping of some internal blockchain functionalities onto legal contracts(e.g., transferring an NFT means &#x201C;transfer of IP rights&#x201D;).</li></ul><p>Curiously, a subset of the problems we tried to solve were later addressed bypractical implementations like <a href="https://zora.co">Zora</a>, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">OceanProtocol</a> and <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. Theircore functionality deliberately doesn&#x2019;t rely on intellectual property licensingfor achieving functionality. Instead they&#x2019;ve made it irrelevant by smartlyapplying emerging technologies.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/zora.png" alt="Zora.co is a &quot;Decentralized Auction Protocol&quot; - take that boomers!"></p><p>So why is it that the COALA IP approach never struck a nerve? I&#x2019;d say that it&#x2019;sbecause it never managed to capture the Internet&#x2019;s Zeitgeist. And because itapplied the intellectual concept too directly.</p><h3 id="Zeitgeist-&#x201C;Did-you-mean-timeghost-&#x201D;">Zeitgeist? &#x201C;Did you mean <em>timeghost</em>?&#x201D;</h3><p>By now it should have become clear that our technology visionaries aren&#x2019;tventuring towards a perfectly interoperable system regarding adjacenttechnologies and institutions. A smart contract has intentionally nothing to dowith a paper contract. Sure, occasionally, there&#x2019;s another one of these boringblockchain conference panels where the same people discuss the meaning of &#x201C;codeis law&#x201D; for the seven-hundredths time - but on a technical level, truly nobodycares about establishing compatibility.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/coleslaw.jpeg" alt="&quot;Code is law&quot; (short: &quot;Coleslaw&quot;)"></p><p>But that&#x2019;s true also for the system&#x2019;s users. For the most part, the internethas stopped caring about intellectual property. There&#x2019;s no angry Metallicafrontman that wants to stop us from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU">downloadingcars</a>. And there are also no lawfirms wanting thousands of dollars because you accidentally seeded an mp3 for anight. You just use Netflix and Spotify.</p><p>It&#x2019;s simply that the idea of what constitutes &#x201C;online media&#x201D; has shifted fromsomething object-like or file-like to something performance-like. We&#x2019;veaccepted that the concept of materiality isn&#x2019;t useful in bits and onlyapplicable in atoms.</p><p>But in the wonderful world of copyright, things haven&#x2019;t shifted that much.Here, from immaterial sources, material goods can be produced by printing paperwith black English letters and by using magical physical signatures and stamps.Ink, &#x2026; fucking stamps? How do they work???</p><div class="owl-media owl-video owl-youtube"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8bhYMnHb5JY" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Instead of dealing with the shortcomings of this annoying piece of legacy, theindustries of intellectual properties have moved on to different things.Brand-building and brand deals, advertisements, mainly performance-based andephemeral outputs. Remember when it was cool to catch the drum stick of yourfavorite rock band&#x2019;s drummer? No? Well, me neither.</p><p>Personally, all creators I care about today: I&#x2019;ve never even met them. I&#x2019;venever possessed any material or object-like piece of them. I don&#x2019;t even feellike wanting to either. I don&#x2019;t worship their work for their objective outputlike I did years ago when I went to the store to buy me the new Linkin Park LP.</p><p>Instead, these days, fandom has become an act of engagement. I help to enhancemy favorite artist&#x2019;s performance online. I promote, react, mention, share, andlike their content.</p><h3 id="We-need-new-tools">We need new tools</h3><p>I also can&#x2019;t blame anyone for making the same mistakes I did when first wantingto make the internet more creator-friendly. As a developer, if you&#x2019;d look intohow intellectual property is laid out from a legal perspective, inevitably,you&#x2019;d come up with a solution that anchors and maps actions onto blockchainfunctions.</p><p>However, it&#x2019;s important to realize that this way of looking at intellectualproperty is becoming irrelevant today. Sure, you can say: &#x201C;<em>But this isliterally how all the industry works right now!</em>&#x201D; and you wouldn&#x2019;t be wrong.But it&#x2019;d also show that you&#x2019;re ignoring the reality of what it means to createtoday.  Creation transferred from an act of materialization to a performance.</p><p>In open-source, a public repository is just as useful as its community ofmaintainers. On Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitch you&#x2019;ll only find successthrough building a permanent online personality. Clubhouse is for sharing hotair and that is the definition of ephermeral.</p><p>Almost no creators&#x2019; works are truly protected by copyright and intellectualproperty licensing. Mostly, they&#x2019;re protected by the creator&#x2019;s aura ofauthenticity and by owning and monetizing an audience. Sure - occasionally, avideo can end up in places where it shouldn&#x2019;t. And it&#x2019;s then rightfullydisputed through the platform&#x2019;s mechanism. But let&#x2019;s be real: The platform&#x2019;smotivation, at that point, is rather upkeeping of consistency than righting awrongful IP licensing.</p><p>IP is mostly irrelevant.</p><p>Given the Internet&#x2019;s real-time nature, I think we&#x2019;ll see even more tools emergethat monkeypatch the legal licensing of digital artifacts.</p><hr><p><em><strong>please consider subscribing to my news letter if you enjoyed reading thispiece</strong></em></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#x2019;ll admit it; I did some good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shoulder_surfing_(computer_security)&amp;oldid=1023421734">shouldersurfing</a>on my flight back to Berlin the other day. The next bit is kinda spicy, butI&#x2019;ll anyways tell you about it: On the flight, there was this guy in a pinkhoodie sitting one seat in front and to the right of me. He held his phone at aheight where it leveled with his eyes, and so sitting in a middle seat myself -I didn&#x2019;t even have much of a choice other than<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:A_Clockwork_Orange#V">viddying</a> hisInstagram browsing habits.</p><p>It was when we were approaching Berlin&#x2019;s new airport &#x201C;BER,&#x201D; and so here we were</p><ul><li>all tucked into our seats - seatbelts fastened and this one douche checkinghis Instagram during our approach to the airport. Though this is verytangential to the story, he had disabled Airplane Mode on his phone early touse his mobile data inflight - we were still hundreds of meters in the air.So while the pilots were busy having the bird touch Berlin soil gently, myguy in front started checking out his Insta.</li></ul><p>And frankly, nothing out of the ordinary happened on that screen - there werethe obligatory pictures of hot girls in bikinis. Some humble shots of<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:A_Clockwork_Orange#B">bugatties</a> onyachts and a general &#x201C;dolce vita&#x201D; vibe with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_hour_(photography)&amp;oldid=1033749526">goldenhour</a>filters left and right.  But in between, there were the targeted ads. And to mysurprise, these were mega-effective. So effective that upon our plane reachingthe airport&#x2019;s gate - the guy had put several items into his &#x201C;Ralph Lauren&#x201D;shopping cart.</p><p>Well, Hannes - if you&#x2019;re reading this - I wish you all the best fun wearingthat sick blue polo shirt at your next yachty party (we were on a Ryanairflight).</p><p>And though, I found this experience rather striking - it wasn&#x2019;t my intentionspecifically to expose that guy&#x2019;s Instagram browsing habits in this post.Rather, I wanted to draw a picture of contemporary Instagram usage in 2021 andthen compare it to what is happening with cryptocurrencies these days, lol.</p><p>The connection leading to this story originates from a talk show I recentlywatched, featuring Hito Steyerl, Joseph Vogel and Ville Haimala. It&#x2019;s the mostrecent episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btQRji5fU_8">Studio Bonn</a> on&#x201C;Crypto-Capitalism&#x201D;.</p><p>I won&#x2019;t spoiler any of the content here except for saying that Ville, being amember of the band Amnesia Scanner, made a statement about comparing NFTs toInstagram posts. Specifically, he remarked that their data structure allowsNFTs to be platform-independent social media. So whereas all posts on Instagramare constantly at the mercy of its arbitrary moderation policy and the assumedcontinuity of the service&#x2019;s existence - an NFT transcends these weak points bystoring the media &#x201C;off-platform&#x201D; and by making its access and meta datainteroperable.</p><p>That comparison struck me as profound. It did so as I had been working foryears on an intellectual property licensing framework called <a href="https://www.coalaip.org/">COALAIP</a> to allow digitizing Copyright claims andlicensing deals on blockchains. I&#x2019;ll admit that throughout my journey within<a href="https://ascribe.io">ascribe.io</a>, working with smaller projects later on andeven trying to build an<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC-721</a><a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/ERC721-wallet">wallet</a> myself - I had to face manyfrustrating blockers with regards to Ethereum&#x2019;s way of implementing NFTs.</p><p>And hence, just before the big NFT craze in 2021, in 2020, I stopped working onit. To me, that standard, the ERC-721, didn&#x2019;t seem useful for what I was tryingto achieve. And indeed, I ended up doubling down on that believe by <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/">publiclyremarking that an NFT&#x2019;s provenance won&#x2019;t guarantee the authenticity many thinkitdoes</a>.</p><p>Today, by writing this post, I feel more confirmed by contemplating Ville&#x2019;sstatement of comparing the NFT standard to an interoperable Instagram post.Indeed, it&#x2019;s a perfect fit.</p><p>Yes, you may attribute value to an NFT by selling it on a marketplace. Yes,that value may be astronomical and irrational today. And indeed, the propertiesof atoms is different than the one of bits. But if you misjudge the relevanceof these properties - I think you may miss one particularly importantobservation.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/stealingthescream.gif" alt="Copying the picture of &quot;The Scream&quot; many times on my computer (2015)"></p><p>The data structure of an NFT is strikingly similar to that of an Instagram,Facebook, or Twitter post. It&#x2019;s a link to a media element, e.g., an image or avideo and a description - all that meta data is then related to a particularidentity, your Ethereum address, or ENS name.</p><p>Yes, there&#x2019;s no distinct feed that lets you like or retweet an NFT yet. Today,NFTs don&#x2019;t &#x201C;look and feel&#x201D; instagramish. There&#x2019;s also a lack of targeted adsand probably hence also a void of golden hour Luis Vuitton yacht photos.  Butthat&#x2019;s because the current NFT infrastructure, unlike Instagram&#x2019;s, doesn&#x2019;treward creators for being on yachts wearing expensive clothes. It&#x2019;s not aboutfake it till you make it - the idea of NFTs is to reward credibility andprovenance.</p><p>So indeed, I&#x2019;d conclude for today that the NFT data structure is the perfecttechnical and conceptual foundation for building a free Instagram, Facebook, orTwitter.</p><p>It does so by making social media posts platform-independent and abstractingthe ownership and accessibility layer away from the platforms and into thehands of creators and fans.</p><p>So don&#x2019;t worry - NFTs are NOT coming to &#x201C;revolutionize the art market&#x201D; -funnily enough, they&#x2019;re coming with full force to disrupt the attentionmonopoly of Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. And thoughthat was something I never anticipated or deliberately worked towards in mywork - I can&#x2019;t wait for that to happen.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In software engineering, there&#x2019;s an infamous but reoccurring situation, I thinkis relatable for every developer and project manager. You&#x2019;re never safe fromit. It can assault you at any moment: During a peaceful standup, when readingissues on GitHub, or during lunch with co-workers. It&#x2019;s when <strong>the scope blowsup</strong> having crept into your project&#x2019;s issues and code - mercilessly expandingand driving everyone nuts: <strong>&quot;OMG, WE HAVE SCOPE CREEP!&quot;</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/images/shockedstoner.gif" alt></p><p>First, let&#x2019;s take a step back and define what is meant by scope creep.Intentionally, I&#x2019;ll focus on defining it from a manager&#x2019;s perspective becausethat&#x2019;s where I suspect it originates. So what is scope? I&#x2019;d say that scope isthe sum of all things needed to deliver a software product given a specific setof expectations and a date.</p><p>If we want to build an instant messenger app, its scope would likely encompassa feature that allows sending messages to others. Maybe it&#x2019;d include sendingsmilies. Or photos. But what about voice calls? Well, that&#x2019;s where thinking interms of scope becomes useful. If we deem that voice calls aren&#x2019;t part of ourproduct offerings, we&#x2019;d consider it <strong>&#x201C;out of scope.&#x201D;</strong> That&#x2019;s when we&#x2019;d saythat &#x201C;we&#x2019;ve discovered scope creep&#x201D; or that &#x201C;scope is blowing up.&#x201D;</p><p>It&#x2019;s curious to see that the English Wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scope_(project_management)&amp;oldid=1016322255">Scope (projectmanagement)</a>is tiny, considering how fundamental the concept seems to be in softwareengineering these days. Given this lack of rigid facts, however, I feel happyto just reason from my experience in the extension of this article. Continuing,I&#x2019;ll just shoot from the hip.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/shootingfromthehip.png" alt></p><p>Here&#x2019;s a non-verified claim: Scope creep is subject to Murphy&#x2019;s law. So ifscope can increase, it will increase. I&#x2019;m not sure why that is, and indeed somebehavioral psychologists have one day have an excellent explanation; but fornow, you&#x2019;ll have to take it for what I&#x2019;ve observed. I&#x2019;ve said - when scopecreeps, it&#x2019;s when everyone loses their minds.</p><p>But why? What is so bad about scope creep that people blame it for theircompany&#x2019;s failure, for leaving a job, or for burning out? It sure sounds likeit encompasses incredible risk. And I think it does.</p><p>For a project manager and their team that&#x2019;s bound to deliver a roadmap, scopecreep can make them look like failures and potentially lead to them missing outon future funding. Scope creep can mean the end of a project.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because for outsiders, given a lack of equal distribution of informationabout the project&#x2019;s challenges, scope creep can look like a team is failing orhaving lost focus. &#x201C;Why are they not able to deliver their roadmap?&#x201D;, &#x201C;This onefeature, what does it have to do with the product&#x2019;s main value proposition?&#x201D;&#x201C;It looks like they&#x2019;re failing.&#x201D;</p><p><img src="/assets/images/spongebobchaos.gif" alt></p><p>While, of course, from the inside, things can look dramatically different.Scope creep is seldom god&#x2019;s irrational punishment for the team&#x2019;s sins (<em>loldunno why I wrote that</em>). Indeed, scope creep may just be the differencebetween expectations and reality. It may just be a specific lack ofinformation. It may be a few thousand missing in the budget or the lack of aspecific team mate.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think, however, that scope creep is ever unjustified. Every scopecreeper has a reason for creeping. It may be that their proposal is flawed andunnecessarily blown up. But ultimately, assuming that all contributors aregood-natured towards the project, I&#x2019;ve made the experience that a scope creeper(a person that blows up scope) is looking at the problem from a unique point ofview and is seeing something others aren&#x2019;t.</p><p>I&#x2019;d argue that as software engineers, we should embrace blowing up scope more.And we should learn to work with it. I know it sounds crazy, but your softwaremanagement process can adapt to extracting immense value from knowledgeprocesses by appropriately managing creeping scope.</p><p>I encourage you to think about scope creep like this: It&#x2019;s when you found aproblem so vast and sinister that none of your team dares to face and slay it.It may be so huge; other teams may not dare to confront it either. Hell, it maybe so colossal NOBODY HAS EVER dared.</p><p>But in turn, what does this mean economically? It means that you&#x2019;re leavingvalue behind. See, today&#x2019;s internet is oversaturated with life hacks,workarounds, and quick fixes. It&#x2019;s good because it lets you focus on the taskat hand. It&#x2019;s bad because it makes us believe that focusing on the short-termis appropriate for solving problems. We&#x2019;re leaving value behind, an example:</p><p>Maybe you&#x2019;ve used a tool like docker before, and given its complexity, at onepoint, you discovered this annoying bug. You could solve it yourself - but youfear it&#x2019;d blow up your project&#x2019;s scope.</p><p>Upon searching the web, you find a GitHub issue created two years ago. It nowhas 1000 comments, and you scroll down to find the most appropriate workaroundthat fits your project&#x2019;s needs.</p><p>Now, considering that 1000 people each wasted one hour of their work timelooking at this issue, I think it&#x2019;s easy to estimate the problem&#x2019;s weight.Hypothetically, would you solve it: It&#x2019;d mean you could cash-in on saving athousand well-paid developers one hour. Undoubtedly that&#x2019;s a massive amount ofmoney.</p><p>The problem is: You cannot because it&#x2019;d mean to blow up your job&#x2019;s scope ten ora thousandfold. <em>And that&#x2019;s where I see an issue.</em></p><p>Assuming you&#x2019;d be able to solve the issue on a technical and economic level,you&#x2019;d progress in your career. But it&#x2019;s not possible - as there&#x2019;s neitherunlimited budget on your project nor enough time or talent to subsidize you.So, inevitably, you&#x2019;ll hence go for the short-term workaround.</p><p>With all that in mind, I still think there&#x2019;s the chance to discover adeliberate practice to face scope creep more adventurously. Some scope creepswill inevitably make the project fail - even if handled carefully. Others -when solved correctly - may enrich your product and give you the right edgeover the competition. What I believe should be avoided, though, is a compulsionand unjustified caution towards scope&#x2019;s increase.</p><p>You can think of solving a problem like traversing a tree or diving into areef. You can go breadth-first or depth-first. Your mind is capable ofback-tracking too. And even having traveled deeply, reality often offers theopportunity to resurface and take a breather before going down again.</p><p>So go out there young padawan - blow up some scopes!</p><p><img src="/assets/images/mindblown.gif" alt></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you read my blog regularly, you&#x2019;ve probably noticed that I like to complainabout the state of my favorite cryptocurrency: Ethereum. It started years agowhen I claimed that &#x201C;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2019/02/28/poa/">shipping to a Proof of Authority network is a badidea.</a>&#x201D; I followed it up with twoposts rambling about <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">how Ethereum&#x2019;s design makes it challenging to buildexcellent web applications</a> and howits <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">finance-oriented market politics ruin dapps for most users as gas priceskeep rising</a>.</p><p>The context is that I&#x2019;m trying to build a decentralized app (short: dapp)myself (<a href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>). In that process, I facechallenges that I journal here. Today - big surprise - I&#x2019;m back with anotherone of these! With one that&#x2019;s focused on a pet peeve of mine: Trying to scalewith insufficient technological sophistication.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s happening right now in the Ethereum ecosystem: Though the Berlinhard fork and its subsequent block gas limit increase was a success, gas feeshave continued to be insane. Tangible Layer 2 (short: L2) scaling solutions are<a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/">visible on the horizon</a>, but my vision isblurred - there&#x2019;s lots of new information to take in and process. Havingdedicated significant parts of my career towards finding scaling solutions forblockchains: I&#x2019;m trying to reassess where we are. I can&#x2019;t say for now. I&#x2019;llneed more time and dedicate more research.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/ethgasfees.png" alt="Ethereum gas fees of 1000 gwei per gas from May 21,2021"></p><p>But here&#x2019;s the more significant problem: Not being able to strategically assesswhat to build and where is a problem in execution. See, in November, <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/12/11/rugpullindex/">I starteda project that rates data sets by their market&#x2019;squality</a>. I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s beengoing well so far for anything but the blockchain-related technical components.The project&#x2019;s eventual idea is to create an ERC20 token akin to an index fund&#x2019;sETF that holds multiple assets in a specific quantity. Think of<a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a> like an S&amp;P500 but for data setsinstead of American companies.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/rpiscreenshotmay.png" alt="A screenshot of my project&apos;s website in May 2021"></p><p>I&#x2019;m burning to make it happen, but I&#x2019;m struggling to move forward on atechnical level. There are no &#x201C;technical challenges&#x201D;, as I could build on theEthereum mainnet. After all, I&#x2019;m familiar with the tech, and I&#x2019;d be able to codethat.</p><p><strong>However, the blocker at this point is of an existential matter: How&#x2019;s Ethereumgoing to look like in, e.g., three months, one year, five years?</strong> How am Isupposed to make an informed decision about building on mainnet when I don&#x2019;tknow where it&#x2019;s going to go?</p><p>For now, the facts are these: Executing a single on-chain asset swap is in therange of 100k gas. At times, that can be 500 to 1000 USD in transaction fees.Multiply that by 10x, and you have the transaction fee for a single rebalancingof rugpullindex&#x2019;s fund assuming ten assets. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, for sure, isthere a way to rationalize that action by only executing it when it&#x2019;seconomically sound for its users - e.g., when enough capital uses the index.</p><p>However, the problem is that having my product directly dependent on theEthereum mainnet&#x2019;s performance may impact its safety and quality.</p><p>What if we need to rebalance the index, but the network&#x2019;s congestion continuesto increase, making the product&#x2019;s position permanently economically unsound? Anexample: Assume we&#x2019;ve distributed the index token to, say, 20 users. It&#x2019;sfinancially sound for them to pay a transaction fee of 5$ / month to rebalance.But then gas prices increase, and now suddenly it costs them 50$ / month for thesame service. Now, for many, it may not be a sound investment anymore. Whatabout the index&#x2019;s functionality - does it still make sense in that environment?</p><p>Of course, I thought deeply about solutions for this. But there weren&#x2019;t a lotof options that came to mind. Here are two tangible things that developers aredoing these days to avoid the problem:</p><ol><li>Ship to a side chain.</li><li>Ship to a rollup.</li></ol><p><strong>About (2) shipping to a rollup</strong>: The problem is that they don&#x2019;t exist yet on themainnet. I mean, they do exist, but primarily specialized to a use case.</p><p>I could be building on the beta version of, e.g., Optimism&#x2019;s L2 rollup. Thatto me, however, is the equivalent of gambling with my time and focus on thehypothesis that Optimism will indeed ship a conceptually ideal platform for mydecentralized app. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong; I don&#x2019;t doubt that their product will begreat eventually. But there&#x2019;s an undeniable chance that they won&#x2019;t ship what Ineed. And there&#x2019;s even a chance that they won&#x2019;t ship at all. Also, I don&#x2019;t wantto make bets when building software. I want to base decisions on facts.</p><p><strong>Then, the answer must be in (1)</strong>, shipping to a side chain-like, e.g., Polygon.But there are even more significant problems. In fact, I find it incrediblyshort-sighted and inconsiderate of many projects in the space to &#x201C;just&#x201D; ship toside chains. It&#x2019;s like taking the easy way out when uploading your contracts toside chains like xDAI, Polygon, etc&#x2026;</p><p><a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2019/02/28/poa/">In 2019, I argued that the context you in ship matters as it determines yourassumptions when engineering theproduct</a>. I want to double down onthat statement today: When you ship on a side chain, you get a side chainproduct and vice versa. That&#x2019;s not a new insight but just another facet of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conway%27s_law&amp;oldid=1024184133">Conway&#x2019;slaw</a>.</p><p><strong>I think most of us agree that the primary value of the Ethereum mainnet, sofar, has come from the composability of its smart contracts, the possibility ofprojects to cross-pollinate, and its liquidity</strong>.</p><p>And now I&#x2019;m supposed to solve high gas fees by shipping on a side chain? Ithink we&#x2019;re deliberately ruining all of the above positives to serve our user&#x2019;sapparent lust for convenience by shipping on sidechains. I consider such aproblem-solving strategy a &#x201C;don&#x2019;t.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s development driven by instantgratification and short-term gain. Nothing more.</p><p>So then, finally, given this existential execution crisis: how am I supposed toaddress the issue? My idea: with direct control and a principled approach.</p><p>I know that value is concentrating on the most technically sophisticatednetwork - that being Ethereum L1 mainnet right now. I know that L2 is superiorfrom a safety perspective compared to side chains. Transitively, this meansthat more value will accrue on L2 than on side chains eventually. I also knowthat by either building on L1 or L2, I&#x2019;ll build my dapp &#x201C;the right way&#x201D; (froman assumptions perspective) - but also: that I&#x2019;ll remain in control over myapplication&#x2019;s execution environment when shipping towards the mainnet (eitheron L1 or L2).</p><p><strong>Finally, it&#x2019;s essential to realize that I won&#x2019;t have to ship towards eitheroption</strong>. I can invent a third option too. And in fact, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;vestarted to do.</p><p>If my problem is Ethereum mainnet&#x2019;s gas prices, then what can I do to decreasethem? Recently, I gave suggestions that could cut transaction fees in half forautomated market maker apps <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/19/ethereum-web3-saving-gas-mainnet/">by avoiding sending an on-chain <code>approve</code>transaction</a>.I started reaching out to L2 builders to learn more about rollups, too.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, while browsing /r/ethereum, I stumbled upon an impersonation attackusing NFTs called &#x201C;sleepminting.&#x201D; I ended up taking a closer look as I wantedto understand the idea of the attack. Here&#x2019;s how it works.</p><h2 id="The-Bait">The Bait</h2><p>Oh, look, it&#x2019;s beeple&#x2019;s multi-million dollar piece &#x201C;<a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x5fbbacf00ef20193a301a5ba20acf04765fb6dac:40914:0xc6b0562605d35ee710138402b878ffe6f2e23807">the first 5000days</a>&#x201D;for sale on rarible. Check the screenshot, It clearly says &#x201C;Creator: beeple.&#x201D;Wow,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-auction-christies-nft-buyer-idUKKBN2B42MM">Metakovan</a>must have gotten badly rekt having to sell that $69M combo-breaker for ahandful of <a href="https://eth-converter.com/">WEIs</a>.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/rariblesleepminting.png" alt></p><p>Please don&#x2019;t fall for it! It&#x2019;s a scam. Or shall I saw an <a href="https://nftheft.com">artpiece</a>? That&#x2019;s right! Its creator, <strong>Monsieur Personne</strong>,that also goes by the self-proclaimed alter ego <em>The Banksy of NFTs</em>,deliberately minted the piece under beeple&#x2019;s name using a technique he calls<strong>sleepminting</strong>. Why? Because Monsieur is disappointed in NFTs.  So how did hedo it?</p><h2 id="The-Basics">The Basics</h2><p>NFTs are created using ERC-721 smart contracts. They the ownership record ofNFTs as a list of pairs.  One address and a piece&#x2019;s serial number make up apair. Like this (I replaced &#x201C;Bob&#x201D; with &#x201C;Booble&#x201D;):</p><ul><li>Alice: 1</li><li>Booble: 2</li><li>Malory: 3</li></ul><p>Upon a sale, Alice can transfer her piece to Boople by:</p><ul><li>transfer 1: Alice ==&gt; Booble</li></ul><p>Now, the list of pairs is updated as follows:</p><ul><li>Alice:</li><li>Booble: 2, 1</li><li>Malory: 3</li></ul><p>In Ethereum, we don&#x2019;t use clear names for identification but addresses. And weneed to sign transfers to authorize them. But in the examples provided in thispost I&#x2019;ll use clear names to simplify explaining.</p><p>Now, usually developers implement ERC-721 contracts in a reasonable way. As weexpect Alice can then only transfer a piece if she owns it and can deliver avalid signature. But what happens if a developer doesn&#x2019;t respect thisconvention?</p><p>See, the ERC-721 standard is just a social contract that defines a interface toallow art platforms to interoperate. There&#x2019;s no criteria for what&#x2019;s a good andwhat&#x2019;s a bad implementation. As long as a contract&#x2019;s interface matches that ofan ERC-721 contract, any machine is considering it as valid.</p><p>But, as we&#x2019;ve now seen, that can lead to safety issues with NFTs&#x2019; provenance onEthereum. It can be tampered with!</p><h2 id="The-Attack">The Attack</h2><p>As I said, any reasonable ERC-721 contract would allow a minter only to mint tothemselves and to only transfer the pieces they own.</p><p>But say we customize our ERC-721 contract such that we can mint to otheraccounts. And say that we adjust the transfer function so that our account can,in a minor exception, also transfer another person&#x2019;s pieces. <strong>Well then, wecan build a contract that allows us to sleepmint pieces</strong>. So as the attackerMalory, we&#x2019;d do the following: We&#x2019;d mint a piece with the serial number 1 toBooble:</p><ul><li>mint 1: address(0) =&gt; Booble (executed by Malory)</li></ul><p>Now our pairs look as follows:</p><ul><li>Alice:</li><li>Booble: 1</li><li>Malory:</li></ul><p>Then, since Malory has adjusted the contract to transfer the piece with serialnumber 1 from Booble&#x2019;s account to any other account, she can offer it for saleon an NFT platform like rarible.</p><p>As she minted from <code>address(0)</code> to Booble as &#x201C;Creator: Booble&#x201D; is displayed.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/rariblesleepminting.png" alt></p><p>Once Malory successfully deceived a buyer, she receives her Ethers andtransfers the piece to the buyer:</p><ul><li>transfer 1: Booble =&gt; Buyer (executed by Malory)</li></ul><p>The updated ownership record now reads:</p><ul><li>Alice:</li><li>Booble:</li><li>Malory:</li><li>Buyer: 1</li></ul><p>And with that, Malory has successfully tampered with the NFT&#x2019;s provenancerecord to sell her piece for more than it&#x2019;s worth.</p><h2 id="The-Specifics">The Specifics</h2><p>So is this attack breaking NFTs? Should you panic sell your collection ofcrypto punks? What about poor Metakovan. He rekt now?</p><p>I&#x2019;d say no. Sure, rarible and Etherscan state wrongly that beeple has minted apiece that genuinely he didn&#x2019;t. However, that&#x2019;s more of an interface issue thanit is a security vulnerability. Nobody ever had access to beeple&#x2019;s account.</p><p>Also, the impersonater can be spotted when taking a closer look at the origintransactions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x57f23fde8e4221174cfb1baf68a87858167fec228d9b32952532e40c367ef04e">Fake mint transaction</a></li><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x57f23fde8e4221174cfb1baf68a87858167fec228d9b32952532e40c367ef04e">Fake transfer transaction</a></li></ul><p>Let&#x2019;s take a closer look at these transactions.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/etherscansleepminting.png" alt></p><p>For the mint transaction, we can see that Etherscan displays two &#x201C;From&#x201D; fields:One for which <code>msg.sender</code> sent the transaction and another one to state theNFT&#x2019;s sender.</p><p>For the transaction&#x2019;s from field, the <code>msg.sender</code>, it <em>cannot be manipulated</em>as it requires a valid signature from the sender&#x2019;s private key. Theauthorization of the &#x201C;From&#x201D; field for the NFT&#x2019;s sender is, however, subject tothe smart contract&#x2019;s implementation and, hence, may not display authenticatedinformation.</p><p>Simply put, the NFT&#x2019;s sender field could display any data an attacker picks.</p><p>Hence, to spot a sleepminted piece from an original, one has to check if boththe mint transaction&#x2019;s sender and the NFT&#x2019;s sender match beeple&#x2019;s correctaddress.  If not, it&#x2019;s a fake.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I love this attack. It&#x2019;s similar to <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rug pulling</a> inthat it also plays with the user&#x2019;s trust towards an online identity. We think,now that we use blockchain, all our web2 problems are gone. Every piece of datais authenticated and checked for authorization. But the truth is that theseproblems aren&#x2019;t gone. They&#x2019;ve just shifted somewhere else.</p><p>We humans cannot reproduce cryptographic verification in our brains. Sure, wecan be extra careful and only trust green checkmarks and lock symbols in userinterfaces.  But can we recompute hashes of files or the validity of a digitalsignature?  No.</p><p>And so the rise of new attacks on web3 is inevitable. I for one am lookingforward to learning from them.</p><hr><h2 id="Further-reading">Further reading</h2><ul><li><a href="/#writing">All posts</a></li><li>2021-08-22: <a href="/2021/08/22/intellectual-property-will-become-irrelevant/">Intellectual Property Is Becoming Irrelevant</a></li><li>2021-07-21: <a href="/2021/07/21/nfts-are-coming-for-instagram/">NFTs are coming for Instagram and other social media platforms</a></li><li>2021-10-21: <a href="/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">On-chain, The Emperor Wears No Clothes</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To an Ethereum developer, it shouldn&#x2019;t come as a surprise that Ethereum&#x2019;smainnet gas fees are insane. For months or weeks now, ERC-20 transfers anddecentralized exchange (short: &#x201C;DEX&#x201D;) swaps have come in at roughly $50 intransaction fees.  Suddenly finding myself affected by the situation, too, Itook to the pen to publicly claim that &#x201C;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">Ethereum isn&#x2019;t funanymore</a>.&#x201D; Andwhile some say that <a href="https://github.com/flashbots">flashbots</a> and the rolluprollout may make matters more bearable, it&#x2019;s my opinion that it&#x2019;ll be anotherwhile.</p><p>But then how&#x2019;s a practical software engineer supposed to solve the solution?Indeed, my inner VC would blab something like &#x201C;<a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/10/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase/">Apps =&gt; Infrastructure =&gt; Apps=&gt;Infrastructure</a>,&#x201D;but is that genuinely actionable advice for builders?</p><p>I&#x2019;ve tried convincing others that Ethereum&#x2019;s infrastructure could be better. Mytake: <a href="https://rugpullindex.com/blog#ScalingEthereumOneTxAtATime">Light clients could help to savegas</a>. However, I&#x2019;mneither too influential in the space nor can I have canons full of VC fiat tofurther my ideas. So then what&#x2019;s left?</p><h2 id="Following-Pieter&#x2019;s-advice">Following Pieter&#x2019;s advice</h2><p>It&#x2019;s always a good idea to trust the legacy knowledge of a dead person, right?Well, let&#x2019;s say, at least they won&#x2019;t have much of a chance of turning out to bean idiot on Twitter later simply because, you know, they&#x2019;re dead and hencecan&#x2019;t tweet.</p><p>But putting that tangentant/weird thought aside for a second, here&#x2019;s one ofPieter Hintjens&#x2019; great ideas: &#x201C;<strong>Don&#x2019;t have a technical vision. Solveproblems!</strong>&#x201D; [3]. OK, so gas prices are too damn high.  What can we do aboutit?</p><p>Well, hear me out, <strong>how about&#x2026; we make transactions use less gas!</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/images/unwantedadvice.png" alt></p><p>And how do we make transactions use less gas? We do so by reducing the usage ofexpensive <a href="https://ethervm.io/">EVM opcodes</a> in our blockchain scripts. Or bysending less transactions. Hence, the rest of this post summarizes my researchinto how to use less gas.</p><h2 id="A-Problem-Wasteful-approve-Transactions">A Problem: Wasteful <code>approve</code> Transactions</h2><p>On April 18, 2021, Ethereum processed 1,396,766 transactions, of which 915,104(65,5%) were ERC-20 token transfers [1, 2]. Having an ERC-20 contract interactwith another contract (e.g., a DEX) means that there will be an<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-allowance-address-address-"><code>allowance(address owner, address spender)</code></a>transaction first <em>before</em> transferring any value from A to B.</p><p>But why is that? See, conceptually, an ERC-20 token is a script that runs as asingleton on Ethereum. It&#x2019;s akin to an ordinary object (as in &#x201C;Object-orientedprogramming,&#x201D; short &#x201C;OOP&#x201D;) but technically called a &#x201C;contract&#x201D; (as in &#x201C;smartcontract&#x201D;). A developer constructs it upon deployment to chain. Other contractslike automated market makers are, too, built like singletons.</p><p>Further, this means that a contract can own state and make it selectivelyaccessible. It&#x2019;s similar to how classes work in, e.g., JavaScript. There&#x2019;s astate variable, and we must access it through getters and setters.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">Store</span> {</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="title function_">constructor</span>(<span class="params">a</span>) {</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">a</span> = a;</span><br><span class="line">  }</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">set</span> <span class="title function_">a</span>(<span class="params">value</span>) {</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">a</span> = value;</span><br><span class="line">  }</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">get</span> <span class="title function_">a</span>() {</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">a</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  }</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Hence, for an object <code>store,</code> that is an instance of the class <code>Store</code>, wewouldn&#x2019;t be able to directly access <code>this.a</code>. Instead, we can only set it usingits setter method. Hence, we have no control over <code>this.a</code> from the outside.</p><p>EVM languages like Solidity and their token contracts (e.g. ERC-20) use thisexact logic to transfer tokens between parties.  Do you want to send one from Ato B? Sure, then to move your token, call the contract&#x2019;s setter function<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-Transfer-address-address-uint256-"><code>transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)</code></a>to edit the underlying mapping between addresses the number of tokens they own.</p><p>Now, the problem of having to call the <code>allowance</code> function before making a<code>transfer</code> arises when interacting with a token through a third-party contract.</p><p>A typical use case is to swap two tokens on a decentralized exchange. As it hasto send back the counter pair of your swap (e.g., you trade WETH for USDC),it&#x2019;ll have to guarantee to receive your WETH when its sending out USDC inreturn.</p><p>Hence, when a user calls a DEX&#x2019;s swap function, the DEX will contact the user&#x2019;stoken contract to <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-"><code>transferFrom(address user, address DEX, uint256 amount)</code></a>to ingest the user&#x2019;s WETH and then transfer its USDC to the user.</p><p>As all of this happens in a single and atomic transaction, that will fail ifany of its sub-operations fail, a DEX contract can ensure the safety ofswapping of two tokens. However, since the swap contract has no authority oversetting another user&#x2019;s token balance by, e.g., calling <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-"><code>transferFrom(address user, address DEX, uint256 amount)</code></a>,an upfront <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-approve-address-uint256-"><code>approve(address DEX, uint256 amount)</code></a>transaction is required.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why you have to do two transactions when you&#x2019;re starting out trading on,e.g. Uniswap.</p><h2 id="Quantifying-&#x201C;wasteful&#x201D;">Quantifying &#x201C;wasteful&#x201D;</h2><p>Still, you may say that an <code>approve</code> transaction may only have to be sent oncefor a given token and a third-party contract. And that&#x2019;s an acceptablehypothesis. But let&#x2019;s look into how wasteful that is.</p><p>We can do so using the logs of Ethereum called &#x201C;events.&#x201D; To query for them, wetake an event&#x2019;s function signature and hash it using<a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html">Keccak-256</a>.</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">keccak256(&quot;Approval(address,address,uint256)&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&gt; 8c5be1e5ebec7d5bd14f71427d1e84f3dd0314c0f7b2291e5b200ac8c7c3b925</span><br><span class="line">keccak256(&quot;Transfer(address,address,uint256)&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&gt; ddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Using <a href="https://duneanalytics.com/queries/35211">Dune Analytics&#x2019; brilliant API</a>,we can then query all of last week&#x2019;s logs in Ethereum (from block<a href="https://etherscan.io/block/12230342">12230342</a>) to find how many <code>Approval</code>and <code>Transfer</code> events there are. Comparing<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-Approval-address-address-uint256-"><code>Approval(address,address,uint256)</code></a>and<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-Transfer-address-address-uint256-"><code>Transfer(address,address,uint256)</code></a>events there were. It&#x2019;s</p><ul><li>41759397 <code>Approval</code> events; and</li><li>445308438 <code>Transfer</code> events.</li></ul><p>Of all Ethereum <code>transfer</code> transactions last week, it means that 9,4% signaledan <code>Approval</code> event. Assuming that the goal of every <code>Approval</code> event is afuture <code>transfer</code> transaction, then 9,4% of <code>transfer</code>s still require anupfront on-chain <code>approve</code> transaction today. Put differently: Approvingtransactions before a transfer is a potentially wasteful practice that we canoptimize to save the Ethereum network roughly 10% of transaction fees.</p><h2 id="Gas-Saving-Improvement-Proposals">Gas-Saving Improvement Proposals</h2><p>Indeed there are a few canonicalized ways to avoid upfront <code>approve</code>transactions. Using <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612">ERC-2612</a>, anadditional <code>permit</code> function allows a user to sign and relay an approvalmessage offline. In turn, that allows skipping the need for an on-chain<code>approve</code> transaction. A battle-tested implementation is available in <a href="https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2ERC20.sol">UniswapV2&#x2019;s ERC20 tokenscript</a>.</p><p>Another way of forgoing an additional <code>Approval</code> is by implementing either<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677">ERC-677</a> or<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777">ERC-777</a>. Both of these proposalsdetail an extended <code>transfer</code> function that, upon calling, would reach out tothe receiving third-party contract to update its state too solving the problemof having to send two on-chain transactions.</p><h2 id="A-Call-for-Further-Work">A Call for Further Work</h2><p>Shaving of gas from transactions or shrinking transaction processes seems likea helpful method for significantly improving a dapp&#x2019;s user experience and forunclogging the Ethereum mainnet.</p><p>The above-quoted Ethereum Improvement Proposals look useful to generate gassavings today. They should be implemented by contract owners ASAP.</p><p>However, I feel there&#x2019;s a need for further work in this direction. Usingcompression and indexing techniques, I&#x2019;m sure there are additional economicallysound gas-saving opportunities.</p><p>In case you are the author of an approach or the finder of one, please makesure to forward them to me via email (tim (at) daubenschuetz (dot) de).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My good friend and collaborator <a href="https://www.granzotto.net/">Alberto Granzotto</a>recently started helping to get people vaccinated at home in the ItalianRegione del Veneto. He has helped deliver 16 shots, with 173 sleeves alreadybeing rolled up and ready for vaccination.</p><p>Since my move to Berlin in 2015, Alberto and I have been collaborating onprojects. But with <a href="https://github.com/vrde/serenissimo">Serenissimo</a>, aTelegram bot that books COVID-19 vaccine appointments automatically, Alberto ison a personal mission.</p><p><strong>T: I&#x2019;ve heard you&#x2019;re helping get people vaccinated now. How come?</strong></p><p>A: I wanted to get my mom vaccinated. She&#x2019;s 74 and had become frustrated withtrying to book a vaccination appointment online. So I decided to help her.</p><p><strong>T: What was the problem?</strong></p><p>A: To get vaccinated against COVID-19, she had to visit a website provided bythe Regione del Veneto and book an appointment first. The process is asfollows:</p><ol><li>She goes to the official website<a href="https://vaccinicovid.regione.veneto.it">https://vaccinicovid.regione.veneto.it</a>to find the public health office where she&#x2019;s registered. Then;</li><li>she enters her data.</li><li>If there is an available spot, she can reserve it and get vaccinated.</li><li>If there is none, she has to go back to step number one.</li></ol><p>To receive her vaccine, my mom started constantly checking the website butended up getting frustrated by having to enter her information over and overagain.</p><img src="/assets/images/regionevenetoit.png" alt="A screenshot of Regione del Veneto&apos;s vaccination booking website."><p><strong>T: So what did you do?</strong></p><p>A: I asked myself how I could help to improve the situation. I thought: Why notreverse the communication structure? Instead of constantly having to check thewebsite, why not have a computer do the laborious work?</p><p><strong>T: Great idea. So instead of asking everybody to poll the website repeatedly,your bot inform subscribers when a spot is available?</strong></p><p>A: Correct. But do note that the vaccine situation in Veneto is complex.It&#x2019;s not &#x201C;first come, first served&#x201D;. There are different cohorts and right nowonly people over 80 or with pre-existing health conditions are eligible.</p><p><strong>T: Is that why you ended up building a Telegram bot?</strong></p><p>A. When I heard from friends that their elderly parents were struggling too, Isaw a way to help. My idea is to smooth the UX to make booking appointmentsmore accessible. I also released the bot&#x2019;s source code on<a href="https://github.com/vrde/serenissimo">GitHub</a> as a commitment towardstransparency.</p><p><strong>T: How&#x2019;s is going so far?</strong></p><p>A: As of today, I&#x2019;ve managed to get 16 people vaccinated! Then there are 173eligible people signed up with Serenissimo who are waiting for a vaccine and1218 people who want a vaccination but are currently not eligible.</p><p><strong>T: Wow! And is your bot handling personal data?</strong></p><p>A: Yes. To get an appointment on the official website, users must provide their&#x201C;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Italian_fiscal_code&amp;oldid=1006804529">codicefiscale</a>,&#x201D;the Italian tax code. Anyone can calculate that code using their first and lastname, date of birth, and city of birth. The code ends up being a sequence ofletters and numbers. It&#x2019;s personally identifiable information (short: &#x201C;PII&#x201D;),but not personal health information (short: &#x201C;PHI&#x201D;). I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s your unique IDfor the Italian government. It&#x2019;s private, but not a secret.</p><p><em>Note from the editor: You can find websites that let you calculate ityourself. See below.</em></p><img src="/assets/images/codicefiscale.png" alt="A screenshot of Tim&apos;s hypothetical codice fiscale."><p><strong>T: Interesting. I think we have something similar in Germany. It&#x2019;s called a&#x201C;Sozialversicherungsnummer.&#x201D; And in the US, I guess it&#x2019;s called the &#x201C;SocialSecurity Number.&#x201D; You built your bot in Telegram; how do you make sure yourusers&#x2019; PII is protected?</strong></p><p>A: I have a privacy policy. If a user removes themselves from the service, Imake sure to delete their data. I&#x2019;ve looked into <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#10-deleting-data">Telegram&#x2019;s PrivacyPolicy</a>, and they, too, aredeleting all data.</p><p><strong>T: Could your bot also work by sending SMS?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, I&#x2019;m currently refactoring it such that it&#x2019;s an option in the future.</p><p><strong>T: What do you think is more important, protecting personally identifiableinformation or protecting a person&#x2019;s health?</strong></p><p>A: That&#x2019;s a good question; I think it&#x2019;s a gradient. For example, the &#x201C;codicefiscale&#x201D; is personal, but you cannot do much with it alone. The important thingis to have a policy to delete the data once you don&#x2019;t need it anymore.</p><p><strong>T: Fair! Where&#x2019;s the source code?</strong></p><p>A: It&#x2019;s open-source on GitHub at<a href="https://github.com/vrde/serenissimo">vrde/serenissimo</a>.</p><p><strong>T: Great! I&#x2019;ll take a look. Thanks for answering all my questions. I wish youthe best of success in helping to get more people vaccinated!</strong></p><p>A: You&#x2019;re welcome. If you&#x2019;re in Veneto and need an appointment for a COVIDshot, check out <a href="https://t.me/serenissimo_bot">t.me/serenissimo_bot</a>.</p><hr><p>If you liked this interview, please consider subscribing to my newsletterbelow.

    <title>How To Use Emscripten &amp; WASM in Web Apps</title>
    <link href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/02/25/emscripten-wasm/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, I published a post about <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">how I built WASMSYNTH</a>. As I learned a lotduring the process, the post ended up becoming huge. I even ended up putting awhole section in the post&#x2019;s appendix.</p><p>Then yesterday, a friend of mine asked me about my opinion on emscripten, thetool I had used to build <a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth">WASM SYNTH</a>.Coincidentally, I ended up referring him to the WASM SYNTH post&#x2019;s<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/#appendix">appendix</a>, where Ihad described my build pipeline in detail.</p><p>Today, it made me realize that I could publish that appendix as an individualpost. And so that what I ended up doing. In the following sections, you&#x2019;lllearn about the build process that I&#x2019;m using in the WASM SYNTH project.</p><p>&#x201C;How do I integrate WebAssembly into my regular web app build without bloatingit too much?&#x201D; I wondered when I first started working with WebAssembly. To putthings into perspective: I had just recently switched from Webpack to rollup.jsas I was sick of spending hours setting up Webpack with its ten thousand magicconfiguration options.</p><p>To my surprise, however, neither framework has reasonable defaults for handlingWebAssembly yet.  Notably, when we generated the WebAssembly outputs usingemscripten and they <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/04/loading-wasm">grew bigger than4KB</a>.  Butthere were other problems too:</p><ul><li>rollup.js bundles all source file into a single JavaScript file.</li><li>Booting the app, also means booting react.js, which itself starts a continuousprocess that we&#x2019;ll somehow have to take into account.</li><li>emscripten generates a <code>.wasm</code> and a <code>.js</code> file. The <code>.wasm</code> file containsall C++ source code as well as WebAssembly instructions. The <code>.js</code> file actsas the glue between WebAssembly and JavaScript.<ul><li>In some cases, there&#x2019;s this 4KB size limit on loading <code>.wasm</code> files</li><li>The emscripten <code>.js</code> glue code is super useful. I can recommend includingit into your code deliverable.</li></ul></li><li>The <code>AudioWorklet</code> is supposed to be included into the page by using <code>new AudioContext().addModule(&lt;path&gt;)</code><ul><li>It has a separate global scope. But emscripten&#x2019;s glue code relies on theglobal scope too (<code>Module</code> object)</li></ul></li><li>Rollup.js doesn&#x2019;t have good defaults or plugins for bundlingemscripten-generated <code>.wasm</code> code.</li></ul><p>In the end, this led me to build a custom pipeline to bundle emscripten buildsevery time my source changed. But before I explain how, let&#x2019;s take a step backto understand how emscripten&#x2019;s compilation works.</p><p>On installation, emscripten exports a command-line utility called <code>emcc</code> intothe shell. To demonstrate its capabilities, let&#x2019;s try compiling the <code>Hello World</code> example from the beginning of the post:</p><figure class="highlight c++"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="keyword">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="keyword">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;emscripten/bind.h&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> <span class="keyword">namespace</span> emscripten;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">std::string <span class="title">hello</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>{</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;hello world&quot;</span>;</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> Using embind, we can define `hello`&apos;s external name</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS</span>(my_module) {</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">function</span>(<span class="string">&quot;hello&quot;</span>, &amp;hello);</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To make it executable by a browser, we&#x2019;ll use <code>emcc</code> to compile it to a <code>.wasm</code>and a <code>.js</code> file.</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ emcc main.cc --<span class="built_in">bind</span> -WASM=1 -o main.js</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><code>emcc</code> here simply compiles all functions contained in <code>main.cc</code> into a<code>main.wasm</code> file. Besides, it also generates this glue code (<code>main.js</code>) using<a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html">Embind</a>.It allows us to invoke functions, initially written in C++, directly fromwithin JavaScript as if they were just regular classes. So to make emscripten&#x2019;soutputs work correctly, we&#x2019;ll have to include the <code>.js</code> into the page. On theinitialization of the page, emscripten&#x2019;s clue code is loading the <code>.wasm</code> fileasynchronously. Through some trick, the browser skips the 4KB file size limit,and all our C++ classes are now available as native JS classes:</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">html</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">body</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">&quot;wasm/main.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="language-javascript"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">      <span class="title class_">Module</span>.<span class="property">onRuntimeInitialized</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>) {</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">        <span class="variable language_">console</span>.<span class="title function_">log</span>(<span class="title class_">Module</span>.<span class="title function_">hello</span>());</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">      }</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">    </span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">body</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">html</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So far, so good. But, as I&#x2019;ve mentioned previously, one of the problems now is thatthe <code>AudioWorklet</code>, being spawned in a separate thread with a separate globalscope, won&#x2019;t be aware of emscripten&#x2019;s <code>window.Module</code>. So how do we export codefrom within a Worklet?</p><p>After spending quite some time researching that question, I discovered that theGoogle Chrome Labs team<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/master/audio-worklet/design-pattern/wasm/index.html">recommends</a>transpiling all JavaScript source into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">nativemodules</a>and then simply use ES6&#x2019;s <code>import from</code> syntax. Well, it turns out the JSmodules syntax <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">isn&#x2019;t widely supportedyet</a>,particularly not in <code>Workers</code>, let alone <code>Worklets</code>&#x2026;</p><p><img src="/assets/images/import-support.png" alt></p><p>But luckily, after banging my head another few days against JS modules andother fancy new front end frameworks, I found a surprisingly simple trick.</p><p>I reduce emscripten&#x2019;s outputs to a single <code>.js</code> file that contains the <code>.wasm</code>as base64 string using it&#x2019;s <code>-s SINGLE_FILE=1</code> option. As we need emscripten&#x2019;s<code>.js</code> file to define <code>window.Module</code> in the <code>AudioWorklet</code>&apos;s global scope, Ithen simply append the emscripten JavaScript file with the <code>AudioWorklet</code>&#x2019;JavaScript file to make them configure the same global scope. That allows me toexecute WebAssembly from within a Worklet without using the poorly supported<code>import from</code> syntax. Ultimately, I ended up with the following bash script (oron<a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth/blob/master/scripts/build.sh">GitHub</a>):</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">DIR=<span class="string">&quot;.wasm&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> Generates the .wasm directory if it doesn&apos;t exist yet.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> [ ! -d <span class="variable">$DIR</span> ]; <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">mkdir</span> <span class="variable">$DIR</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">fi</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># NOTE `-std`: To use modern c++11 features like std::tuple and std::vector,</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># we need to enable C++ 11 by passing the parameter to clang through emcc.</span></span><br><span class="line">emcc src/cpp/*.cc \</span><br><span class="line">  -std=c++11 \</span><br><span class="line">  -O1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s WASM=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s BINARYEN_ASYNC_COMPILATION=0 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s SINGLE_FILE=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s MODULARIZE=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  --<span class="built_in">bind</span> \</span><br><span class="line">  -o <span class="variable">$DIR</span>/main.js</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> We concat the emscripten generated js and wasm file with the worklet</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># such that we don&apos;t have to import it later as an es6 module.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ethereum isn&#x2019;t fun anymore. There I said it.</strong> And although, the lasttime I developed an app using it has been more than a year ago, I stand bymy word. <strong>Developing dapps on Ethereum has become annoying</strong>.  Here&#x2019;s why:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/pedro.gif" alt></p><h2 id="I-used-Ethereum-before-it-was-cool">I used Ethereum before it was cool.</h2><p>I know; it&#x2019;s such a hipster statement. But it&#x2019;s true. Ethereum has stoppedbeing edgy. It has transitioned out of its niche to build a world computer.Its community has become huge, and I stopped knowing most faces. Where therewas a feeling of revolution and new beginnings, now there are people in suitstalking corporate. Within just a few years, it went from <a href="https://github.com/DaddyDeFi/DaiDaddy">DAIdaddys</a> and only <a href="https://www.molochdao.com/">half-ironic satanistcults</a> to lending, insurance, and trade protocols.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s Ethereum&#x2019;s killer app?&#x201D; we asked ourselves not long ago.  Now we know.It&#x2019;s the world&#x2019;s best publicly-accessible settlement platform for financialtransactions.  In a way, that&#x2019;s exciting. The markets think so too. But foranyone else that worked with Ethereum but outside of financial applications,it&#x2019;s somewhat of a letdown.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/homer.gif" alt></p><h2 id="How-do-you-do-fellow-Ethereans">How do you do, fellow Ethereans?</h2><p>I think it must have been around the time of the last big crypto bubblewhen Monero enthusiasts called for &#x201C;Making Monero cheap again.&#x201D;</p><p>Monero, being the anonymous digital currency that had indeed just legit usecases apart from the occasional rumors that entangled it in drugtrafficking, had suddenly become too expensive for everyday use. Realizingthe glaring threat of becoming too valuable, its core developers went on tofix the problem by campaigning at CoinDesk&#x2019;s yearly industry gatheringConsensus.</p><p>They announced the &#x201C;Monero Enterprise Alliance.&#x201D; An inside joke,supposed to piss off other projects that had started to take themselves tooseriously. Being slightly confused that day myself, I now can&#x2019;t recall ifthe effort had ever been successful. But in any case, I can&#x2019;t recommendbuying Monero. It&#x2019;s useless.</p><h2 id="Gas-prices-are-too-damn-high">Gas prices are too damn high!</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/deepfried_high_rents.jpg" alt></p><p>There was a phase in my short career as an Ethereum developer where I looked atEtherscan&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href="https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified">Verified Contracts</a>&#x201D; pageall day long to find vulnerabilities in newly uploaded contracts. &#x201C;My name&#x2019;s Timand I&#x2019;m an etherholic!&#x201D;</p><p>It was addictive. I ended up calling a few of those contracts, failing to causeany havoc, sadly. But it was so much fun! Back when transaction fees were stillaffordable on Ethereum, building projects was great.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#x2019;s now roughly seven or eight years that I&#x2019;m building dynamic front ends forthe web. From <a href="https://www.ascribe.io/">digital art wallets</a> to games(<a href="https://ipfs.leapdao.org/blog/Planet-A-ccc-ethberlin-recap/">1</a>,<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/videogame">2</a>) and<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/wasm-synth">synthesizers</a>, I&#x2019;ve seen it all. Andsince my process of creation has dramatically changed over the years, today,I&#x2019;d like to share how I&#x2019;m developing web apps in 2021.</p><h2 id="I-avoid-build-processes">I avoid build processes.</h2><p>I still remember the debates with colleagues about using<a href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a> a few years ago.  Within the front end developmentworld, transpiling had just become a thing, so we ended up babelifying ourbuilds to use ES6. Our argument back then was that one day, we would be able topush our application&#x2019;s directory structure on a web server and since allbrowsers would then support the augmented ES6 features, our app would justwork! Without a build process. WOW!That must have been around 2015. When I look at the source code of these oldapplications now, our technical visions didn&#x2019;t end up becoming reality.</p><p>Now, I try to keep my build process to a minimum. When I need to write a demoapp, I particularly like using <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone#script-tags"><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/babel&quot;&gt;</code></a>.I love <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started/#no-build-tools-route">preact&#x2019;s &#x201C;no build toolsroute.&#x201D;</a>too.  When I have to set up an actual app, I avoid<a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> and <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup</a>. Imainly get frustrated about the myriad ways of configuring them. Some minorthing always ends up being broken, which leads to hours of debugging foreigncode. And that&#x2019;s frustrating. Using preact&#x2019;s no build route, finally somethinglike the above is possible:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&lt;script type=<span class="string">&quot;module&quot;</span>&gt;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> You literally don&apos;t need a build process with preact.</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">import</span> { h, <span class="title class_">Component</span>, render } <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">&apos;https://unpkg.com/preact?module&apos;</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">const</span> app = <span class="title function_">h</span>(<span class="string">&apos;h1&apos;</span>, <span class="literal">null</span>, <span class="string">&apos;Hello World!&apos;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="title function_">render</span>(app, <span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="property">body</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&lt;/script&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>When having to use a build tool, I gravitate towards<a href="https://parceljs.org/">parcel</a> or<a href="https://github.com/developit/microbundle">microbundle</a> as they comepreconfigured. And in particular, parcel is excellent, as it&#x2019;s merely using anHTML file as its entry point. To me, that&#x2019;s promising as it assumes a properdirectory structure and properly connected files such that maybe one day I canpush my app to the web without that build step.</p><h2 id="I-avoid-transpiling">I avoid transpiling.</h2><p>For the same reasons as pointed out above, I also try to avoid transpiling.It&#x2019;s not because I don&#x2019;t like ESNext features, but more because I want tominimize the risk of getting stuck with the transpiler. Hence, I try to avoidusing babel. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/">I also don&#x2019;t useTypescript</a>. To me,JavaScript is productive enough.  Additionally, for<a href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>-style projects, no transpilers mean I stoppedusing <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>.  Instead, I foundan excellent library called <a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> that usesJavaScript&#x2019;s template strings. It has a similar syntax to JSX, but it&#x2019;s notbreaking ECMAScript standards and hence needs no transpliation.</p><h2 id="I-avoid-the-new-and-shiny">I avoid the <em>new</em> and <em>shiny</em>.</h2><p>I even avoid changing the way I work if I don&#x2019;t feel comfortable or inclined.For example, I never switched to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">reacthooks</a>. The <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">lifecyclemethods</a> that I initiallyknow from iOS Objective-C programming are - in my opinion - a beautifulmetaphor for writing front end components. And neither did I have any issueswith my sites&#x2019; performance. I would make the switch if I started to haveproblems. But I don&#x2019;t.  The same goes for up and coming frameworks. Angular V2?<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>? Cool, but why relearn a framework when I&#x2019;m alreadyproductive with the one I use?</p><h2 id="I-test-EvErYtHiNg">I test EvErYtHiNg.</h2><p>When I started front-end development, testing was complicated. Only a few frontend developer colleagues tested their apps properly. I ended up doing a lot oftesting by hand. It was frustrating and unproductive.  But testing front endshas improved dramatically over the years. Not only have the tools beensignificantly enhanced.</p><p>We, as front-end developers, have now also figured out how to correctly writefront end tests.  Finally, we&#x2019;re able to distinguish between functional codeand presentational code.  For functional code, we now write unit tests. Forpresentational code, we use snapshot-based testing and integration tests. I&#x2019;mpleased about tools like <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a> that is great forintegration tests. I also like <a href="https://github.com/avajs/ava/">ava</a> for unittests.</p><h2 id="I-optimize-for-performance-and-quality">I optimize for performance and quality.</h2><p>I used to be eager about building extensively functional software: the morefeatures, the better. I&#x2019;m not anymore. Instead, I try to develop software thatworks well for my users. I strive for quality. So I try to measure my build&#x2019;ssize. I take proper care about delivering my application, meaning I turn oncompression and<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">caching</a>. I careabout optimizing my static assets like pictures. And I like to check my apps byusing tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=de">PageSpeedInsights</a> or<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.</p><h2 id="I-use-my-own-work">I use my own work</h2><p>From experience, I learned that I hardly ever get stuck on a algorithmicproblem. On the contrary, I get motivated to learn something new and excel inthe process. However, I caught my self often spending many hours on debuggingother people&#x2019;s code. Mainly when it&#x2019;s third-party libraries that I included vianpm. Once, I thought that using npm packages was a JavaScript developer&#x2019;ssuperpower.  Now, I know that it can also be their curse.</p><p>Instead of collecting heaps of third-party code, I now prefer following <a href="http://hintjens.com/blog:96">PeterHintjens&#x2019; principles for writing good code</a>.  I&#x201C;use my own work.&#x201D; Meaning, I dare to write seemingly complex code myself. Istill won&#x2019;t roll my own crypto or write a date library, but I dare to implementparts of a protocol or build an algorithm. It&#x2019;s not to say that I ditch everynpm package and go npm-keto-diet. No, instead, I take a more mindful approachtowards dependencies and only include them when I truly need them.</p><p>I try to do that by leaving my technical vision at the doorstep of my office,so that I can now focus on solving the problems at hand. I try to stop worryingabout eventualities far in the future as I view that as speculation. In cases Ihave past experiences, I use it to form my decision. For unchartered teritory,I move carefully, step by step.</p><h2 id="I-use-open-source-to-my-advantage">I use open source to my advantage.</h2><p>I&#x2019;m building websites since I&#x2019;m a teenager. And had I open-sourced andmaintained a few pieces of code that I need frequently, I&#x2019;d be more productivenow.  Unfortunately, I was short-sighted. Surprisingly, I didn&#x2019;t think aboutstill using JavaScript at 29 years of age &#x1F602;</p><p>I stopped framing open source mainly around certain virtues like free speech,fairness or certain politics. They&#x2019;re still important virtues for me, but Ilearned that I could use open source also for building a personal toolset.</p><p>Extracting a library from a codebase allows me to think about it from a user&#x2019;sperspective. It means I&#x2019;m able to think about a piece of code&#x2019;s interfacesemphatically. Additionally, there&#x2019;s positive peer pressure.I&#x2019;m not going to release shit to the world. When my project is public, it&#x2019;sgoing to have a proper README and some docs. And it&#x2019;s going to be tested. Sinceeverybody can see it, I might as well create something I can be proud of.</p><p>Hence, contributing to open source, for me, is about building high-qualitysoftware. Being anxious about not being able to monetize this particular pieceof code has become less of a concern.<a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresohrus</a> inspired me to treat opensource packages like my personal toolbox.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>And that&#x2019;s my incomplete list of principles. I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s more than justthese. Anyway, I still find some of these points quite controversial.  I&#x2019;m surethey won&#x2019;t work for everyone as all our contexts differ.  But working solo as afreelancer, I&#x2019;ve found that these principles contribute to me being contentabout what I&#x2019;m doing. Hence, I was eager to share them.</p><p>I&#x2019;m curious to hear other&#x2019;s thoughts and see if they&#x2019;ve taken similar paths.Please reach out! Also, don&#x2019;t forget to subscribe to my newsletter!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a synthesizer that allows streaming directly to an internetradio stream for rc3 2020.</p><p><strong>UPDATE from April 1, 2021:</strong> I&#x2019;ve now taken WASM STREAM offline as itspurpose was mainly to serve last year&#x2019;s rc3. The rc3 world has been takenoffline too.  This means that some links in this blog post are not availableanymore. Probably all source code that was used in the project is available onGitHub.</p><hr><p>It&#x2019;s that time between Christmas and new year again, where you can usually findme at Leipzig&#x2019;s Congress Zentrum on my computer hacking away. It&#x2019;s chaoscongress time. Given this year&#x2019;s pandemic, the &#x201C;37c3&#x201D; however, was moved to theinternet and renamed to <a href="https://rc3.world">&#x201C;rc3&#x201D;, the Remote Chaos CommunicationCongress</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, the iconic congress build-up started. This time around,building up didn&#x2019;t involve moving heavy crates of mate tea around. Instead, itmeant that everyone started designing, drawing, and building their assemblymaps for the &#x201C;rc3.world&#x201D;. A <a href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/">2D virtualspace</a> that&#x2019;ssupposed to replace this year&#x2019;s lack of physical space.</p><p>The rc3.world software is a fork of <a href="https://workadventu.re/">workadventu.re</a>,a 2D game simulating a virtual work environment with avatars. Within this 2Dmap of the virtual congress, the organizers invited all assemblies to buildtheir own spaces. And so, as the build-up for <a href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtionProtocol</a> assembly began, I had an idea for aproject.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/wasm-synth-screenshot.png" alt="wasm-synth, the project Ilaunched at last year&apos;s c3"></p><p>At last year&#x2019;s congress in Leipzig, I had launched<a href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>,a synthesizer built in WebAssembly. Naturally, this time I was eager to takethe project to the next stage. Hence, roughly a week ago, I started to work ona new project called &#x201C;WASM-STREAM&#x201D; - an extension to wasm-synth.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol/wasm-stream">WASM-STREAM</a> is avirtual stage for digital artists. Using WASM-STREAM, an artist can broadcasttheir play with wasm-synth to an internet radio stream.  More importantly,though, this means that they can take the stage on the <a href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtionProtocol</a>&#x2019;s assembly and jam away to a virtuallypresent audience.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/wasm-stream.png" alt="Social Dist0rtion Protocol&apos;s dance floor in the rc3.world"></p><p>So how did I build it?</p><h2 id="A-First-Little-Demo">A First Little Demo</h2><p><a href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a> is a project that I builtdeliberately to showcase the power of the web. At the beginning of the year, Iwrote <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">a blog post</a> outliningits technical details. It&#x2019;s using the <code>AudioWorklet</code> and someWebAssembly-transpiled code to render audio in real-time in the user&#x2019;s browser.</p><p>Now, workadventure, the software ccc uses to run their rc3.world, is also builton the web and allows embedding audio streams. So I thought, why not take theaudio generated in wasm-synth and stream it to everyone in the rc3 world.</p><p>In a way, it sounds like not that big of a deal to build an audio streamingclient within a website. But remember that a browser&#x2019;s networking ability islimited. While we&#x2019;ve come a long way from the <code>XMLRequest</code> API to <code>fetch</code>,<code>WebSocket</code> and <code>WebRTC</code>, these concepts only allow talking upstream if theirauthors deliberately built their upstream application for supporting them.</p><p>Naive as I Am, I started by deploying <a href="https://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> to asmall Hetzner instance. I configured an authorized mount point that allows astreamer to connect using client software.  Then I looked for a way to streamaudio directly to icecast from a browser. And found&#x2026; nothing.</p><p>Well, I did find something. It&#x2019;s called <a href="https://webcast.github.io/">webcast</a>,and it&#x2019;s a <a href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">WebSocket-basedsubprotocol</a> thatallows sending binary audio data between a client and a server. In their<a href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js#server">README.md</a>, the authors alsomention webcast&#x2019;s compatibility with<a href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/">liquidsoap</a>, a DSL for audio stream processing.</p><p>So my first attempt at plugging these things together involved encoding the<code>Float32Array</code> data from the <code>AudioWorklet</code> into an mp3 stream using<a href="https://github.com/toots/shine/">libshine</a> (that has a wasm JavaScriptpackage) and then sending it to a <a href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/harbor.html">liquidsoap&#x201C;harbor&#x201D;</a> via webcast.Liqidsoap would then convert the mp3 stream to ogg-vorbis, make it stereo, andforward it to the icecast server.</p><p>And, to my surprise, it worked. When I hit some keys on the wasm-synth, theygot encoded and sent to the audio stream. With a bit of delay, I heard what Ihad just played. Cool!</p><p>Anyways, with my small little demo, I was galvanized and motivated enough tospend more time building something that would work for the congress.</p><h2 id="The-WASM-STREAM-Architecture">The WASM-STREAM Architecture</h2><p>Ultimately, liquidsoap was not well-suited for my purpose. I also quicklyrealized that all I had to do was build a proxy between the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ePirat/adc3b8ba00d85b7e3870">icecastprotocol</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">webcastprotocol</a>. Andthat&#x2019;s what I ended up building. A small <a href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">JavaScriptapplication</a>implementing two protocols.  It listens for incoming WebSocket connectionsand calls icecast with a loooooonng PUT request to establish a stream.</p><p>WASM-STREAM itself doesn&#x2019;t do any encoding. It can, however, route an<code>audio/ogg</code> or an <code>audio/mpeg</code> stream from webcast to icecast. The encodingfrom WAV to mp3 takes place on the user&#x2019;s device already when the play thesynthesizer.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-WASM-STREAM">How To Use WASM-STREAM</h2><p>Whether you have a ticket to rc3 or not, you can tune into the stream at<a href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream">https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream</a>.It&#x2019;s an mp3-encoded stream, meaning it won&#x2019;t work in all browsers equally(Firefox works natively; Chrome et al. only support ogg/vorbis natively). If itdoesn&#x2019;t, try a desktop application like iTunes or VLC.</p><p>The stream is continuously online. But if you don&#x2019;t hear anything then that&#x2019;sbecause nobody is currently playing the<a href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">WASM-SYNTH</a>.</p><p>Finally, you&#x2019;re able to &#x201C;dance&#x201D; on the Social Dist0rtion Protocol&#x2019;s assemblydance floor. The rc3 orga was nice enough to allow us streaming audio on ourmap. <a href="https://rc3.world/rc3/room/93840a8f-88f7-4f11-bb61-68800c4d4962/">Clickhere</a> tovisit us directly on the rc3.world map.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="TL-DR">TL;DR</h2><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a financial index that <strong>rates data sets</strong> by their markets&#x2019;performance (<strong>liquidity</strong> and <strong>equality of liquidity shares</strong>).  <strong>Check outthe <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">website</a></strong> and the minimalistic<a href="https://rugpullindex.com/changelog.txt">blog</a>, or keep on reading the article.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/rugpullindex.png" alt="A screenshot of therugpullindex.com website" style="border: 5px solid #2bbc8a; border-radius: 5px;"></p><h2 id="Why-Building-a-Data-Set-Index">Why Building a Data Set Index?</h2><p><strong>Would you pay a stranger on the internet</strong> to buy a data set they&#x2019;re offeringwithout knowing them or ever having seen the data? Tough decision! But that&#x2019;sprecisely the type of situation <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a>users face in its newly-launched decentralized <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">data setmarket</a> [3].</p><p>I&#x2019;ll spare you most of the details of how it all works and say this:2020&#x2019;s most transforming technology has been <strong>on-chain markets</strong>. Inparticular, the implementation that <a href="https://uniswap.org/">uniswap.org</a> is usingcalled <strong>automated market makers</strong>.</p><p>Simply put, they work by incentivizing users to <em>pool</em> a pair of assets at aratio they deem as the assets&#x2019; current prices. These users, I herein call them<strong>liquidity providers</strong>, e.g., pool 1 ETH and 540 USDC, so that when a buyer ofeither asset comes along, they can immediately trade 1 ETH for 540 USDC or 540USDC for 1 ETH. This principle works fantastically at scale, as the poolincentivizes liquidity-providing by charging buyers and sellers a small fee,which is distributed by the pool to each liquidity provider, respectively [1].</p><p><img src="/assets/images/marketmakers.png" style="background-color: white;border: 5px solid black; border-radius: 5px;"></p><p>This model has been so successful that there&#x2019;ve been days wheredecentralized trading on Uniswap outperformed volumes on Coinbase! Which, ofcourse, has lots of implications on the cryptocurrency space. I think it&#x2019;s nooverstatement to say that automated market makers may be <strong>the killer app forcrypto</strong>.</p><div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1300034164830408704"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>But there&#x2019;s one implication I&#x2019;ve been particularly keen on exploring: all <strong>theopenly-accessible data produced by on-chain markets</strong>. See, if you ever triedbuilding a trading bot, you&#x2019;ll have noticed the terrible resolutionpublicly-available market data has. You might have also noticed that it&#x2019;s quitedifficult even to find data at all. It&#x2019;s not by accident. <strong>Trading data isvaluable</strong>.</p><h2 id="Rating-a-Data-Set-by-its-Market&#x2019;s-Performance">Rating a Data Set by its Market&#x2019;s Performance</h2><p>Remember when I asked you at the beginning of this article about <strong>buying a dataset from a random stranger on the internet?</strong> Well, it turns out that OceanProtocol is now betting on the same technology that made Uniswapsuccessful. They allow users to publish a data set, along with a fungible<strong>data token</strong> and an integrated <strong>automated market maker</strong>. Meaning, you cannow buy access to a data set by purchasing tokens. These tokens get priced byliquidity providers providing a ratio of OCEAN Tokens to <em>data tokens</em>.</p><p>However, just because data sets are now available for sale on the market, doesn&#x2019;tmean you know they&#x2019;re valuable! After all, if <a href="http://ebay.com">ebay.com</a> didn&#x2019;t have a ratingsystem for sellers, how would you know which seller to trust?</p><p>On <a href="http://ebay.com">ebay.com</a>, you know which seller to trust because you can see how manyarticles they&#x2019;ve sold and what each buyer&#x2019;s experience was. It&#x2019;s a simpleidentity-based rating system.</p><p>But within the anarchistic world of cryptocurrencies, there are no workingidentity-based rating systems! Instead, the space is filled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account">sockpuppets</a> and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybils</a>. <strong>Then, without buying adata set first, how are we supposed to know if a data set is valuable or anoutright scam?</strong></p><h2 id="Introducing-rugpullindex-com">Introducing <a href="http://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a></h2><p>That&#x2019;s where <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a> comes into play. <strong>Wecrawl all of Ocean Protocol&#x2019;s data token pools daily</strong> and rate each market&#x2019;sliquidity provider distribution by its equality using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Ginicoefficient</a>. While rankingmarkets based on their liquidity is common industry-practice, calculating aGini score for each market&#x2019;s liquidity provider shares isn&#x2019;t. The idea behindthis is that the more liquidity providers with an equal share back an asset inthe market, the less likely it is for a &#x201C;rug pull&#x201D; attack to happen (details<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/multi-repo-issue/issues/30#issuecomment-726132174">here</a>).By factoring in a pool&#x2019;s relative liquidity, it allows us to derive a score $s$that is $0 &lt; s &lt; 100$.</p><p>For users of <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>, this <strong>yields afew attractive benefits</strong>:</p><ol><li>They can now choose to adjust their data set investments based on marketdata.</li><li>They can decide to invest in data sets relative to their performance onto <em>increase their diversivication and hence lower their exposure risk</em>.And finally;</li><li>If they&#x2019;re unsure about <strong>sending a random stranger on the internet moneyfor a data set</strong>, they can check out the data set&#x2019;s market performance tomake an informed decision.</li></ol><p>It&#x2019;s a widely-known fact that index-based investment yields superior resultscompared to stock picking [2]. The same is true when <em>investing</em> in data, whichmakes me excited about working on this project.</p><h2 id="What-Does-The-Future-Hold">What Does The Future Hold?</h2><p>I have many ideas for <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a> and not asmuch time as I&#x2019;d like to have.  However, my overarching goal is to make theranking so reliable that I can build a smart contract-based index fund on topof it.</p><p>I think that rating assets based on their markets&#x2019; performance is valuableoccupation in itself. Not only within the data set market but beyond. I&#x2019;mparticularly interested in rating a wide range of on-chain asset markets, butI&#x2019;m also thinking about rating more on-chain intellectual property markets. I&#x2019;meager to crawl more data and explore. Until then, I hope you&#x2019;re having funusing <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>.</p><p><em><strong>If you have questions, feedback, or business inquiries, please contact me:<a href="mailto:tim@daubenschuetz.de">tim@daubenschuetz.de</a></strong>.

As we just had released our browser-compatible JavaScript driver,enthusiastically, I told the audience: &#x201C;&#x2026; and so by using our driver fromwithin the browser, your app won&#x2019;t need a backend anymore&#x201D;!</p><p>That must have been around 2017 when I first discovered Metamask, and starteddrinking Ethereum&#x2019;s web3 cool-aid. Arguably, web3 quickly becamesomething extraordinary. All of a sudden, users could download a browserextension and directly interact with a public network. In a sense, it stillis extraordinary.</p><p>If you have an extension like Metamask installed in your browser today, you canvisit sites on the web that allow you to do the craziest things with yourdigital money. An excellent recent example of this are DeFi (short for&#x201C;Decentralized Finance&#x201D;) websites. They allow a user to engage in tradingcryptocurrencies, providing liquidity, and peer to peer lending.  With theclick of a button and no mandatory signups, you&#x2019;re able to pool thousands ofdollars. That is super cool and confirms the viability of the web3 vision.</p><p>But actually, what is the web3 vision? It may be that there never was such athing in the first place. All I know is that someone named a library &#x201C;web3.js&#x201D;.Developers use it to talk to remote or local Ethereum nodes when working in abrowser environment (JavaScript).</p><p>On a web3-enabled website, when a user now clicks a button to, e.g., pool etherin a smart contract, most calculations are supported by the web3.js librarythat periodically talks to an Ethereum node. Ultimately web3.js allows the userto send the transaction to the node to transfer the user&#x2019;s money.</p><p>Often, a key-management program, like Metamask, is running on the user&#x2019;sbrowser. It allows the user to sign transactions with the same key on differentwebsites.</p><p>In a nutshell, that&#x2019;s web3. It&#x2019;s supposed to be a play on words regarding &#x201C;web2.0&#x201D;. Web 2.0 is the upgrade of web standards that gave us modern single-pageapplications and dynamic AJAX loading. And Web3? An advancement towards whatexactly? Money websites?</p><p>Indeed, if you were capable of cleaning your mind of specific memories,specifically, let&#x2019;s say you could do <code>grep -l web3 brain | xargs rm</code>. And thensomeone asked you how you&#x2019;d envision a blockchain-based andsmart-contract-enabled web3; you&#x2019;d likely describe an ecosystem vastlydifferent to what it is today. You&#x2019;d think about peer-2-peer networks, lightclients, and renewed web standards. That&#x2019;s precisely not web3.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s experience it will instead be mostly shitty react websites thatcrash or stop working when you&#x2019;ve neglected to install Metamask (or otherkey-management plugins). Opening a web3 website&#x2019;s network console, you&#x2019;ll seethat it&#x2019;s making an excessive amount of RPC request to an Ethereum full node.Sorry, I meant to say Infura node, a hugely-popular cloud provider hostingEthereum full nodes. That&#x2019;s kinda stupid.</p><p>And since Metamask allows developers to prompt the user for specific contractcalls, what&#x2019;s even more stupid, is that all your money may be at the risk ofcontinually getting stolen with the accidential click of a button. Either bysomeone hacking the website&#x2019;s server. Or by the website providerbecoming corrupt themselves. Or simply because a website pretends to do X whenit does Y (stealing all your money).</p><p>But instead of continuing to rant, I&#x2019;d now like to now point out what I thinkshould change about web3:</p><ul><li>We should stop building key-management plugins and start thinking about astandardizable web API. We must stop training our users to install shittybrowser plugins!</li><li>We need to make light clients work as soon as possible and become independentfrom third-party services like thegraph and Infura.</li><li>We need to improve our client libraries (ethers.js and web3.js) bydramatically simplifying them and making them bug-free (god damn it!)!</li><li>We need to take advantage of some of the blockchain&#x2019;s fundamental properties.Most data is immutable so let&#x2019;s start caching things.</li></ul><p>And finally, I think we should stop focusing all of our attention on bumpingthe web&#x2019;s version number. Maybe we should reconsider writing more backends. Weshould promote more work on permissionless networks like Open Gas StationNetwork that allow developers to upgrade a user&#x2019;s experience. And, we shouldstart thinking of a machine network of blockchains more often. In many ways,web3 was just a cool demo. But let&#x2019;s come up with something better. Justimagine what happens once there&#x2019;s a deeper integration of money into computersystems!</p><hr><h2 id="Further-reading">Further reading</h2><ul><li><a href="/#writing">All posts</a></li><li>2021-08-22: <a href="/2021/08/22/intellectual-property-will-become-irrelevant/">Intellectual Property Is Becoming Irrelevant</a></li><li>2021-02-22: <a href="/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">Ethereum isn&#x2019;t fun anymore</a></li><li>2021-07-21: <a href="/2021/07/21/nfts-are-coming-for-instagram/">NFTs are coming for Instagram and other social media platforms</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <title>TypeScript is weakening the JavaScript ecosystem</title>
    <link href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In recent months, I&#x2019;ve noticed a dramatic increase in TypeScript packageson GitHub. I usually come across them when checking repositories of thepeople I follow like. Or, when I&#x2019;m looking for dependencies to solve aproblem in my projects. And the more TypeScript packages I&#x2019;m encountering,the more often I get reminded of this little annoyance towards the project.</p><p>My context is that I&#x2019;ve not looked into TypeScript yet. That means I have noidea how it works. Unfortunately, this is now starting to become kind of aproblem when searching for dependencies.It does, when I either willingly or accidentally include a TypeScript packageinto my projects. Mainly because my package-choosing criteria include:</p><ul><li>picking packages that I potentially can contribute to (e.g., a lesser-knownpackage that contains well-written code); or</li><li>picking packages that are well-maintained by a large community but mayinclude code that I&#x2019;d not be able to easily contribute to (e.g., a popularpackage using a C library internally)</li></ul><p>I&#x2019;ve put these criteria in place willingly to achieve a certain qualitystandard when building applications. Either because I can fix bugs myselfquickly, or because I&#x2019;m able to rely on a strong community to fix them.However, with TypeScript packages in npm, there&#x2019;s now this opaque problem ofnot knowing the language or quickly telling a package&#x2019;s language and itscommunity size. Also, TypeScript could be just another CoffeeScript.</p><p>So essentially, the problem is that TypeScript authors publish their packageson npm, the package manager for Node.js. And to me, that&#x2019;s what is weakeningthe JavaScript ecosystem.  Since its inception, and throughout trends likeCoffeescript, npm has mostly held the promise of only hosting JavaScriptpackages. However, this promise is <code>rejected()</code> (lol) by many authorspublishing their TypeScript-to-JavaScript transpiled packages.</p><p>Indeed, it makes sense considering that Microsoft markets TypeScript as a&#x201C;superset of JavaScript&#x201D; and since it &#x201C;compiles&#x201D; to JavaScript, why not publishpackages to npm? But in terms of equality and identity, TypeScript is notJavaScript. After all, you&#x2019;d not consider C and Objective-C the same either, orwould you? In both examples, the languages are subsets/supersets but wereconceived with different goals in mind to solve other problems.</p><p>Therefore, TypeScript authors should, in my opinion, do something along thefollowing lines:</p><ul><li>namespacing their TypeScript packages; or</li><li>build and publish their packages to their package manager.</li></ul><p>However, continuing to publish TypeScript packages to npm is, in my opinionweakening the JavaScript ecosystem as it&#x2019;s splitting its community andpolluting the npm namespace.</p><h2 id="Controversy">Controversy</h2><ul><li>For a short time, there was an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24344506">intenseconversation</a> on Hacker News.But for unknown reasons, my post got marked as <code>[flagged]</code>. I&#x2019;ve written anemail to the operators.</li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The week before the first of May, I drove home to visit the family. After all,we had planned to go skiing when the virus hit my region of origin quiteharshly. Additionally, my grandparents weren&#x2019;t doing all that well, so therewas no consensus in the family on what to do genuinely.</p><p>I stayed in Berlin. At least half of my friends drove southwards to theirfamilies. And then in the south, I have no idea what people did. But naivelyjudging by the numbers, Berliner&#x2019;s (at least in March) were less naughty andpaid close attention to their central coordinator (the German government, theWHO?).</p><p>And then the second half of March and first of April were really just theweirdest moments of my life. Suddenly, there was actual social distancing andnot physical distancing. It seemed that not only I but everyone was strugglingone way or another. I felt mistrust building, especially since proper videocalling simply didn&#x2019;t work well, but also since nobody was supposed to go outand have a healthy life. My natural paranoia gave it the rest.</p><p>But I think the weirdest part in all of this story played the city of Berlin.Why? Because it seemed that people genuinely didn&#x2019;t give a shit about thevirus, but at the same time, everything worked so smoothly. I mean, nothing hadchanged in the city. People went to parks, had their coffee. Some even stillwent to work. Already in &#x201C;the outbreak&#x2019;s&#x201D; first week, lots of shops hadcompletely turned around their money-making procedures. Instead of having toenter a cafe, now you had to scream &#x201C;due Cappuccini&#x201D; through a street-levelwindow. The barista, a weird looking hipster guy, would then in safe proximitybrew your drink while suddenly you were able to pay cashless.</p><p>Yes, you heard that right. You were able to pay cashless. In Berlin. But notonly that. Additionally, the guy had set up a considerable area of veryspacious benches outside. That meant keeping a safe distance while slurpingCappuccini was quickly possible.</p><p>Elsewhere, this early model of successful adaption quickly spread. My localbaker soon had introduced spacious queues and even a pipeline system to handlecustomers. So while they had two entrances and exits before the crisis, theysuddenly had one deliberate entry and one door. Eventually, they went furtherby introducing a cashier person (handling all the money) and a bread person(packing the bread).</p><p>The shop next to the baker did another cool thing. They gave a 25% discount oncashless payments. Not sure they still do it, but I found it a nice touch.</p><p>Many other things happened too. I could go on. However, eventually, I wanted tosee my family, and so I rented a car and drove down south (I used to take thetrain). And I can tell you, it was great! Not having seen my brother, mom, anddad since Christmas, lots of information had to be replicated. Lots of storieshat to be synchronized. Tears, laughter, hope, despair. For sure, we had itall! And eventually, we phased.</p><p>In fact, there was one particular moment that really got me phased (or amazed?)very much. I guess I&#x2019;m telling the story on the about page of this blog posttoo. Anyways, I&#x2019;ve been practicing playing the piano for more than two yearsnow. Initially, however, I had been inspired by my brother&#x2019;s sick e-guitarskills. In a nutshell, the two of us had been competing on playing instrumentsfor a while now. Mainly on the piano, when suddenly I realized he had broughthis e-guitar this time.</p><p>We plugged it in on our parent&#x2019;s patio, and I hit a few notes. Then - he hadfound the old western guitar from my mom - he played a few notes. Suddenly thepiano music theory lessons about harmony and melody started kicking in, and Iwent into improvisation-mode trying to support and/or lead what the two of uswere playing. It was a fantastic feeling! Truly a level-up in life. Jazz ormultiplayer improvisation had always fascinated me. It had fascinated me with aprofound intolerance and frustration of not being able to understand how itworked. But now, since all I had to do was either, hitting low notes when hewas playing high notes, or high notes when he was playing low notes, itsuddenly made sense to me. And not only that. The next days, it also made methink quite a lot about eventual consistency in distributed systems.</p><p>You see. These days all we seem to want is central coordinators with god viewsguiding us. We deliberately trust them with our lives and property. We do itbecause of<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>. Orbecause our collective intuition tells us to throw our dearest values into theflaming pit, faithfully-believing that from the nutritious ashes, a tiny newbud of hope will eventually appear.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure what it was this time we threw. Some argue privacy, others say itwas our freedom to freely travel the globe. In fact, I think that on a globallevel, consistency hasn&#x2019;t emerged yet.  It may be that it will not for manyyears or decades. After all, there&#x2019;s money to be made with this asynchronicity.</p><p>Also, I don&#x2019;t know much about these things, and so probably I should staywithin the realm of my domain to make arguments. And so let&#x2019;s get back to Jazz.Well, actually, let&#x2019;s get back to uhm Cloudcountry and distributed systems.</p><p>A story that I found quite inspiring in all of this is the story of thecreation of Lil Nas X&#x2019;s Old time road. Here&#x2019;s the video:</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sq6zmzE8y3U" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>To me, that video is incredible. It&#x2019;s incredible because it tells the story oftwo entirely socially and physically separate musicians collaborating. Evenmore so as they do it asynchronously, on an idea&#x2019;s output that eventuallyrequires total synchronicity (or strong consistency). I mean, watch the video.The story has already been told. YoungKio and Lil Nax X jazzed across a massivepond of water. They were able to simply create the mega-hit of 2019 (and aweird genre too).</p><p>I&#x2019;m fascinated as in my naive understanding of music, I always thought thatJazz meant breaking the rules of social and physical distancing. I thought itmeant getting together physically as bandwidth and latency of the internetdidn&#x2019;t allow musical cooperation. I felt that through live streaming, we&#x2019;dnever be able to indeed compose collaboratively. But I was wrong. It&#x2019;s notbetter live streams or telephony or central coordinators that we need for musicto truly succeed in times of SARS-CoV-2. What we need today is asynchronousJazz, or as we computer scientists call it: <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> (andCRDTs), but for musicians! I&#x2019;d call it an (.arc(hive)) or <code>.hive</code> :)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just yesterday, I got my hands on a really wonderful graphic novel called <em>&#x201C;TheThrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage&#x201D;</em>. It&#x2019;s about the invention of thefirst computer, the so called <em>analytical engine</em>. It starts by telling thestory of Ada Lovelace&#x2019;s coming of age. And, in particular, about her beingdeliberately pushed into mathematics and kept away from fulfilling any kind ofcreative purpose. That, of course, doesn&#x2019;t go well for too long, before Adastarts learning about &#x201C;imaginary&#x201D; numbers. A concept, so seemingly close topoetry (and madness), her mother becoming worried that Ada could become likeher father. A mad polyamorous poet?</p><p>Anyways, apart from the stories about Ada and her companion Charles Babbage,there&#x2019;s lots of mathematical concepts being nicely animated in comic style.And so there&#x2019;s also this part where Ada&#x2019;s imagination quite literally startsblossoming when she realizes that numbers do not only exist on a singledimension. The book visualizes this really beautifully by Ada literally walkingalong the scale of real numbers, soon realizing that she can carefully climb up<em>imaginary</em> stairs. And so she climbs carefully, but misses a stair at one pointand falls &#x201C;back into reality&#x201D;. Yup, I know, the book is pretty cool.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/ada.png" alt></p><p>Sometimes I just wish, I had the imagination of Ada, when back in college (orwas it high school?), my teachers desperately tried to explain me theconcept of imaginary numbers. I mean, it was not that I didn&#x2019;t want tounderstand, or that I was lazy or not interested. It was just that this wholetopic didn&#x2019;t make much sense to me. Why have imaginary numbers when all youneed in the world is real numbers. After all, there&#x2019;s no imaginary sheep youcould count, and no imaginary apples you could add up. And so the concept ofimaginary numbers actually never stuck with me. Funnily enough, when we learnedabout vectors later, I didn&#x2019;t have any troubles following along.</p><p>Maybe, it&#x2019;s that concept of telling a story, of opening up someone&#x2019;s imaginationthat ultimately allows us to learn and be truly creative. And with that, I&#x2019;dlike to talk about <em>imaginary monies</em>.</p><p>See, in my view, the world today is quite behind its potential. When it comesto money, at least. It&#x2019;s now been, what?, 50 years since the advent of personalcomputers and 20 years since the mainstream adoption of the world wide web? Andstill, we seem to transact like hundreds of years ago.</p><p>But the world has changed. In fact, it changed already in the 70ies, when wefound ourselves at the advent of the <em>information age</em> and the founding of theinformation society. You don&#x2019;t believe me? Well, then get into this red-lookingand playful-looking time machine below and see for yourself!</p><div class="owl-media owl-video owl-youtube"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UiMus1FJb9w" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Isn&#x2019;t it beautiful? To me, at least, it&#x2019;s almost like time-traveling and havinga dialogue with the collective of humans that were responsible for creatingwhat we now call the internet. It&#x2019;s inspiring, because these random strangerstalk so clearly and freely about <em>our world</em>. It&#x2019;s so frightening, becausetoday, at least, I&#x2019;d argue, we&#x2019;re often preceiving <em>their utopia</em> as <em>ourdystopia</em>.</p><p>That does tie nicely into the metaphor of Ada Lovelace climing imaginary stairs.What would happend if she fell from high up back to reality? How hard wouldthe impact be? How long would she fall? Would she bounce back up? Or only leavea hole in the ground? Hard to say, but I&#x2019;d imagine the impact to be less severethan you&#x2019;d think. After all, why should gravity only act in one dimension &#x1F60F;.And so that&#x2019;s why I think we should start exploring radically new paths.Not paths, dimensions. Dimensions of money. Imaginary monies.</p><p><em>Tim. Hold on. What the fuck are you talking about???</em>Okokok. Hear me out! Just one, one last story and then you&#x2019;ll understand!</p><p>Sooo, in the early 2000s the www was really cool. And everybody bought stocksand all nerds got rich and it was great. It was so great that even traditionalor established businesses wanted to go full <em>cyber</em> by hosting their ownwebsites.  One of them was the New York Times, an organization founded astaggering 150 years earlier.</p><p>Now, back in the days, publishing websites was quite difficult. There werehardly any tools. I guess there weren&#x2019;t many developers neither. But mostprobably, the bigest problem was that people were stuck in a creative loop of<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation">HyperNormalization</a>. Thatis, they didn&#x2019;t know what to do with the internet. Maybe, they were scared? Andso in 1996 it happened that the New York Times simply decided to scan theirfront page print and upload it daily as an image on their website. They were soproud, they even published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/22/business/the-new-york-times-introduces-a-web-site.html">anarticle</a>about themselves, quoting a consultant saying: <em>&#x201C;The market is booming for newspaperson the World Wide Web.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Little did they know&#x2026; that you can&#x2019;t just scan your print edition newspaperand upload a picture to your website, because, as McLuhan had realized yearsbefore already: <em>&#x201C;The medium is the message.&#x201D;</em> And hence, the closestresemblence to a truly cyberspacial newspaper may be Twitter,Mastodon or Medium. Well, I guess that consultant was right after all.</p><p>And that my friends, is the epic saga of Hypernormalizations being bornand dying, as they too, can be overcome with a simple trick of the mind:Imagination.</p><p>Today, there&#x2019;s a particular topic that needs more imagination and that is, asI&#x2019;ve already mentioned, the topic of money. Honestly, I think, we&#x2019;d be fine inclimbing the invisible stairs. We&#x2019;re collectively and subliminally aware oftransactional relationships and keeping ledgers in our brain. David Graeber&#x2019;s5000 Years of debt certainly is proof enough of that. I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;d fallfar, as in our deerest need, there&#x2019;s many tricks and protocols in our culturesalready.</p><p>So then, let&#x2019;s explore multi dimensional imaginary money and leave these realand boring concepts behind! ERC20 tokens as reputation on the the Ethereummainnet. Naaaah, that&#x2019;s so 2019. What we build is a reputation token that,acts as a multiplier for our base supply of money!</p><p>Quadratic voting and reputation schemes? Artificially limitted and carefullydistributed token supplies? Naaahh, instead, why don&#x2019;t we make <em>political influence</em>quadratically proportional to your actual spending power? You know, making yourreputation the base, and your money the exponent.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s say we all agree to vote once in a big election. But then you vote twice.Well, now you better have some stash saved under your matress, because you&#x2019;vesignificantly decreased your spending power but increased your political reach.</p><p>I mean, just imagine the possibilities in cybespace, where the relationship ofmonetary supply and political influence couldn&#x2019;t possibly grow exponentially orlineraly. But instead, where we could limit them through governance by adjusting$i$, in:</p><p>$$z = a + bi$$</p><p>where $z$ being the individual&#x2019;s spending power, $a$ being the individual&#x2019;s moneysupply and $b$ being, for example, the individual&#x2019;s political influence.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/imaginary.png" alt="You guessed it right, I stole that picture from Wikipedia."></p><p>I know, it sounds like a long shot now. But I truly think we&#x2019;re not that faraway from ideas like these being put into practical use. In many ways, stablecoins are a first step. So let&#x2019;s take another one!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You all love margarine, right? It&#x2019;s the plant-based version of butter. Actually,I learned about margarine the first time when I was in high school.</p><p>In economics class, our teacher tried to explain to us the concept ofsubstitution goods and so he made an example and said: &quot;A substitute good is agood that can be used in place of another.&quot;<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup> Then hecontinued: &#x201C;Butter and margarine are commonly referred to as substitutiongoods. In the kitchen, they can be used almost interchangeably. If one day, yougo grocery shopping and can&#x2019;t find butter, it&#x2019;s likely not a problem as you&#x2019;llsurvive the week without major hiccups on margarine too&#x201D;.</p><p>And then, he took the chalk and drew a weird graph on to the board thatprobably nobody in the room fully understood.</p><p>That was roughly 12 years ago. And since then, I thought about substitutiongoods quite a few times. It was the usual subjects. Coca-Cola and Pepsi,McDonald&#x2019;s, and BurgerKing. Taking a train vs. buying a car.</p><p>But then today, I had to explain a friend of mine the concept of a substitutiongood, and I intuitively used the example of my teacher: Butter and margarine.But as soon as the words left my mouth, I thought to myself: Poor cows!</p><p>OK, OK. Let&#x2019;s rewind a bit. Also, let me give some context.</p><p>First off, I live in Berlin. And everyone here wants to save the world. Withthe purest intention. So even though you won&#x2019;t notice it much visiting thecity, my peers are incredibly political. But not the standard &#x201C;political&#x201D; YUPPIEyou&#x2019;re thinking. The Berlin youth <em>lives</em> their lives according to strictprinciples.  To the uttermost extend. Quite often, even so much that itburdens friendships. Especially, when you&#x2019;re a vegetarian-diet-red-pill-immuneperson like I am<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>.</p><p>Anyways, beginning last year, I started noticing a trend in how my flatmatesand I feed ourselves. Mainly because this big sausage company, called&#x201C;R&#xFC;genwalder M&#xFC;hle,&#x201D; had begun to expand their meat-free meat substitutionproducts immensely. My die-hard vegetarian flatmate one day came into thekitchen and started a chorus of praise about <a href="https://www.ruegenwalder.de/produkte/vegetarische-muehlen-cordon-bleu">R&#xFC;genwalder&#x2019;s vegetarianCordonbleus</a>.Since each package comes with two, he threw them in a pan, and shortly we wereeating analog meat with analog cheese inside.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/ruegenwalder.png" alt></p><p>And what can I say? I actually liked these more than I liked <em>real</em>Cordonbleus. Simply because I&#x2019;ve always had this childhood trauma of eating ananimal. Even today, every time I bite into a piece of meat, I secretly hope itstaste won&#x2019;t connect much to how the animal smells. I don&#x2019;t know. To me, that&#x2019;sjust terrible as I grew up surrounded by animals in a small Swabian village. Itbreaks my heart and also utterly disgusts me when my body tells me that whatI&#x2019;m eating had been alive just a while ago.</p><p>But with these Cordonbleus, things were much different<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>!  I felt like I could really binge on those things. Noharm is done to animals! I technically can just eat 17 of them today withoutfeeling bad! Also, they taste so great with Sriracha sauce. It was just toogood to be true!</p><p>And so I lived happily, binging on all the great R&#xFC;genwalder Cordonbleus untiltoday when I had to explain this damn concept of a substitution good to afriend of mine.</p><p>See, in my opinion, we&#x2019;ve enslaved animals within our capitalistic system.We&#x2019;re extracting goods from them without their consent and selling them on theopen market. Some policies regulate on how we should be treating animals andgladly, there are BIO labels. I genuinely believe that things <em>are</em> objectivelygetting &#x201C;better.&#x201D; By the numbers, at least.</p><p>What nobody really questions, however, is if the cow would revoke their consentof giving milk if it could. Sadly, though, if you model the brain of the <em>BosTaurus Economicus</em>, the rational cow, I believe it wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily revokeits consent immediately.</p><p>Why? Because it has been domesticated towards what it is today for hundreds, ifnot thousands of years by humans. I&#x2019;m sure some of you have seen the Netflixdocumentaries too. <a href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/">Cowspiracy</a>.<a href="https://www.netflix.com/Title/70100084">Milk</a>. There are so many of these now.Likely and sadly, because cows are now also seen as a significant reason forclimate change. The point of them is that cows today are massively optimizedfor giving milk and meat. They can barely live on their own. They require humanhelp to survive because we&#x2019;ve domesticated them for maximum profit.</p><p>OK. But what has all of this to do with butter and margarine?  Well, for that,we need to enter Donna Haraway&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/staying-with-the-trouble">&#x201C;Staying with theTrouble.&#x201D;</a> In it, sheargues that humanity is currently finding itself in the Anthropocene, ageological epoch that&#x2019;s dating from the commencement of significant humanimpact on Earth&#x2019;s geology and ecosystems (I stole that 100% from Wikipediabtw.). But she goes even further and argues that much of the biology and naturethat we experience today has very much been influenced by humanity&#x2019;s history.</p><p>She talks about how loving carrier pigeons may be the reason for the story ofRomeo and Juliet to exist. But not only that, but she also challenges us byarguing that we humans have an individual responsibility to be <em>response-able</em>towards the domestic animals our ancestors and we have &#x201C;co-created&#x201D;. She arguesfor &#x201C;making kin, not babies.&#x201D; And in general, she argues from atruly-inspiring and honest way of &quot;making kin in the Chthulucene.Chthulucene, being her suggestion for naming Earth&#x2019;s next geological epoch.</p><p>Most importantly, however, Donna Haraway argues for a strategy she calls&#x201C;becoming-with.&#x201D; Essentially a practical way for all critters to live and dieon &quot;terra. I understand it as follows:</p><p>We&#x2019;ve inherited this world. It&#x2019;s full of trouble, but that&#x2019;s OK. Because each andevery one of us has the individual capability to be response-able (to act onour own responsibility). Some of us have quite huge response-ability.Some of us have very small. And some are in-between. Note that she&#x2019;s notparticularly making response-ability a global task. Instead, she&#x2019;sdeliberately making it <em>sympoietic</em> (collectively-producing, decentral control)and not <em>autopoietic</em> (self-producing, central control).</p><p>To me, that&#x2019;s beauty in its purest form. Why? Because it gives each and everyone of us quite concrete guidelines on how we should act towards enslaved anddomesticated animals. We should behave towards them in our personal, mostmorally-sound way. Maybe, today it just means petting a dog or not eating thatburger. Well, tomorrow, it can mean feeding thousands of pigs and not having themslaughtered by an insane monopolized industry.</p><p>OK. But should I buy butter or margarine now???  Well, I think that&#x2019;s adecision entirely up to you! I&#x2019;d still like to make a point about substitutiongoods that I hope vegetarians and vegans may appreciate. It&#x2019;s indeed comingfrom my heart and with no ill intentions in mind. Also, a disclaimer. I haven&#x2019;treally researched this whole point, so while it may be rhetorically correct,factually, it may not. But maybe it&#x2019;s also up to the readers to verify andconduct studies! My idea with this essay is less to convince you about e.g.,buying butter over margarine, and more about the way we can think about today&#x2019;sproblems from an ethical and also economical point of view. So here we go:</p><p>Butter and margarine are substitution goods, meaning they&#x2019;re technicallyinterchangeable in the kitchen. Butter is made from cows&#x2019; milk. Margarine ispurely plant-based. As cows have to be fed with plants, but since plants onlyrequire water and sun, we can simply assume that for the purpose of acooking-fat, margarine is more efficient to produce and hence over a longperiod a cheap alternative to butter.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/substitute.jpg" alt></p><p>Assuming you, e.g., increased the price of butter to improve the livingconditions of a cow, it&#x2019;d mean that you&#x2019;d decrease butter&#x2019;s demand, and at thesame time, you&#x2019;d increase margarine&#x2019;s demand and hence its price. At least inthe short term, it could be argued that given the market&#x2019;s structure, vegetariansubstitute goods are not contributing towards less animal suffering. Instead,the opposite may be right.</p><p>Of course, this becomes even more problematic, the more industry processes andproducts are replacing animal-based ingredients with plant-based alternatives.Not only are plant-based substitutes structurally cheaper to produce as yousimply don&#x2019;t have to feed animals with plants to create them.  Butadditionally, given the fact that you&#x2019;re taking money away, that is paying,e.g., &#x201C;a cow&#x2019;s rent,&#x201D; you&#x2019;re also contributing towards more efficientlyextracting value from animals and hence to more extreme animal suffering.</p><p>In simpler terms: The fewer money farmers have to feed and maintain their lifestock, the more they&#x2019;ll have the incentive to squeeze out every last penny.And judging by my intuition, that will undoubtedly mean more suffering for theanimal.</p><p>Oh jeez&#x2026;</p><p>Yeah, I know! The situation looks quite dire.  Well, yes, it does. But also itdoesn&#x2019;t. Because we&#x2019;ve just looked at cows as rational actors and we&#x2019;ve alsolearned what it means to be a good companion species towards cows. We have tobecome-with with them and act response-able!</p><p>So instead of calling on our politicians to create more rules and complexity,I&#x2019;d like to encourage you today to think like a genuine capitalist. Assumingthat we want to move the world over to vegetarianism or veganism. Consideringthat we want to optimize for as little animal slavery and suffering: What areeconomic policies that could help cows, pigs, and chickens to live and diepeacefully during this phase of <em>aninomic</em> (animal + economic) turmoil? What canhelp in the long-term? What&#x2019;s a solution that could be applied today? Think, discuss,write!</p><p>Here&#x2019;s my take on one idea:</p><p>Venture capitalists always talk about Universal Basic Income for their sacredentrepreneurs. Well, why can&#x2019;t we have one for cows??? For example, couldn&#x2019;t wesimply have a tax on e.g., eggplants that would contribute towards CUBI (cowuniversal basic income)? Mainly, it&#x2019;d be a policy, financing the board andlodge of &#x201C;unemployed&#x201D; cows all over the world. What&#x2019;s stopping us from doingthat? I&#x2019;d pay for it. Would you?</p><p>Also, what policies would you like to create?</p><hr><h2 id="Controversy">Controversy</h2><ul><li>We had an interesting discussion about this article, over in the <a href="https://leapdao.slack.com/archives/C2KNAV6E5/p1587027688144900">LeapDAOSlack</a>.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="Footnotes">Footnotes</h2><p><small><a name="f1">1</a>: Actually, I copied that from Wikipedia.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a synthesizer using C++ and WebAssembly. Check out thefinished <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/wasm-synth/">product</a> (<a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth#compatibility">browsercompatibility table</a>), the<a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth">source</a>, <a href="#the-presentation">watch thetalk</a> or keep on reading the article!</p><hr><h2 id="The-Presentation">The Presentation</h2><div class="owl-media owl-video owl-youtube"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QJ0k_Qa5VGI" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Ever since I started taking piano lessons two years ago, I was curious to takea look into a vastly different field from cryptocurrencies and blockchain.That field being digital audio engineering. So when some of my freelanceprojects ended in November 2019, I decided to allocate my next three monthstowards building an audio product.</p><p>I quickly discovered what I wanted to build: A synthesizer. In C++!  I had justwatched some talks on WebAssembly, and was very curious to learn a new languagetoo! In hindsight, the personal challenge, however, was to understand the datastructures and math that go into generating audio.</p><p>That&#x2019;s the story of how I rediscovered the beauty of mathematics throughbuilding a synthesizer with C++ and WebAssembly.</p><h2 id="Theory">Theory</h2><p>I had never done anything in the field of music technology - I had to startat zero practically. It meant I had to look at the physical, mathematical,and musical fundamentals of audio generation.</p><h3 id="The-Nyquist-Shannon-Sampling-Theorem">The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem</h3><p>Sound is a time-dependent phenomenon. Regular instruments take advantage ofthis phenomenon by emitting sound waves over time through, e.g., a mechanicalpart oscillating. That produces a time-continuous analog signal, which meansthat for each point in time, the signal produces a unique value in amplitude.Computers can merely approximate analog values by sampling them intotime-discrete values.  They&#x2019;re so good at approximating that the digitalrepresentation of an analog signal virtually becomes indistinguishable to ahuman&#x2019;s ear. As long as the sampling complies with some basic rules of signalprocessing, at least.</p><p>A pretty fundamental principle in this regard is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist&#x2013;Shannon samplingtheorem</a>.It states that to capture all necessary information from a continuous-timesignal, a function <em>&#x201C;sampling&#x201D;</em> the signal needs to record data at least at arate twice as frequently as the highest frequency. If this requirement isunfulfilled, then the resulting digital signal contains an artifact called<em>&#x201C;Aliasing&#x201D;</em>, distorting the familiarity of the original signal (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sawtooth-aliasingdemo.ogg">Listen tothis sound bit of aliasing happening on a sawtoothwave</a>).</p><p>Though we&#x2019;re not planning to record analog signal to digital, we&#x2019;ll still haveto comply with this theorem, as synthesizing sound is nothing more than fillinga list with time-discrete values too<sup id="a5"><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>.  Practically,it may look something like this:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">// Simple pseudo code noise generator</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">context = new AudioContext()</span><br><span class="line">samples = []</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">for (i = 0; i &lt; context.sampleRate; i++) {</span><br><span class="line">  // Generate noise</span><br><span class="line">  samples.append(random.choice([0, 1]))</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">// We&apos;ve generated enough samples for exactly 1 second.</span><br><span class="line">// The output will hence be 1 second of noise.</span><br><span class="line">context.play(samples)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here, we&#x2019;re initiating a new <code>AudioContext</code> object, getting its sample rate,and generating enough samples to have the noise last for at least one second.Admittedly, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem is less of a problem here, as the<code>sampleRate</code> is likely to be set to a reasonable value by our pseudo language&#x2019;smagical <code>AudioContext</code>. But assuming it was set to only 200 Hertz, outputting apiano&#x2019;s middle C (its frequency is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies">261.6256Hertz</a>) would already becorrupted, as the required 261 repetitions per second to output middle Cwouldn&#x2019;t fit into the 200 repetitions per second of the sample rate.Practically, what would happen is that our sampling algorithm would be&#x201C;overtaken&#x201D; by middle C&#x2019;s frequency and hence output a shifted version.  Thefigure below nicely visualizes the effect, showing what happens if we&#x2019;regradually increasing the signal&#x2019;s frequency at a steady sampling rate.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/nyquist.png" alt="Undersampling: The signal&apos;s frequency is increased while the sampling rate (dotted line) remains steady."></p><p>But assuming a sufficient sampling rate, there&#x2019;s another problem with the abovecode. Imagine, we substituted the noise-producing snippet with a nice-soundingsine wave and then integrated and sold it as a hardware synthesizer.  Whenpressing a key, the player would hear the respective tone for a second.Pressing another key, they&#x2019;d hear another tone for another second and so on.But since we built our function only to generate static-length tones of aone-second length, it wouldn&#x2019;t be much fun making music, as playing rhythmicpatterns would be impossible!</p><p><img src="/assets/images/frames.png" alt="Large buffer sizes can introduce latency for the user6."></p><p>That&#x2019;s because music doesn&#x2019;t work on an absolute time scale, but on a relativeone. We wouldn&#x2019;t say that a note &#x201C;lasts for a second&#x201D;. Instead, we&#x2019;d say it&#x201C;lasts for a quarter bar&#x201D; and, hence, call it a &#x201C;quarter note&#x201D;. To build asoftware instrument, this means that we&#x2019;ll have to optimize for real-timeresponsiveness and maximum expressiveness. For this, we&#x2019;ll need specific datastructures.</p><h3 id="Frames-and-Ring-Buffers">Frames and Ring Buffers</h3><p>Generally, audio in programming languages is most commonly generated bycontinuously filling up buffers with data points and then sending them to thesound card. But as we&#x2019;ve just learned, that buffer&#x2019;s size determines theresponsiveness of our instrument. An idea that nicely dissolves this problem isto chunk our buffer into <em>frames</em>. Instead of sending a fixed-length buffer ofsamples to the output device, we chunk it into small <em>frames</em> and continuouslysend these.  In theory, we&#x2019;d limit the size of a frame to a single sample formaximum responsiveness, meaning we&#x2019;d now be <em>&#x201C;streaming&#x201D;</em> our data. But giventhat timing is crucial too, we&#x2019;ll have to come up with yet another strategy forsending just the right amount of data in a given time frame. For this, we canuse a different concept called a <em>&#x201C;ring buffer&#x201D;</em>.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/ring-buffer.gif" alt="A ring buffer processing a keyboard&apos;s inputs."></p><p>A ring buffer is a fixed-size list, managed by two distinct pointers, where onepointer is writing values, and the other one is &#x201C;chasing&#x201D; and consuming thosevalues.  It allows a program to continuously stream data, precisely at thespeed of the chasing pointer.  Additionally, it provides developers with a<em>&#x201C;pull&#x201D;</em> rather than a <em>&#x201C;push&#x201D;</em> API.  Now, instead of having to optimize theirprogram to push new frames to the output device periodically, a developer canuse the callback function of a ring buffer&#x2019;s writing pointer to be notifiedabout a shortage of fresh data.</p><p>But so much for theory. Let&#x2019;s explore how we can implement these concepts inpractice.</p><h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2><p>As we&#x2019;ve discussed the most important theoretical concepts in the previoussection, we can now move into the implementation phase. Specifically, we&#x2019;llhighlight three distinct issues that we had to overcome.</p><h3 id="Using-the-AudioWorklet">Using the <code>AudioWorklet</code></h3><p>Today, there&#x2019;s sadly no cross-browser API fully implementing all the aboveconcepts. That requires <em>some</em> improvisation when trying to build a synthesizerfor the web. Naively, one might think that <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> allowone to implement a ring buffer quickly. However, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29972322/1263876">their accuracy can&#x2019;t betrusted</a><sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>.  Alternatively, there&#x2019;s the web audio API&#x2019;s<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScriptProcessorNode"><code>ScriptProcessorNode</code></a>.And while it allows hooking into the output device&#x2019;s streaming process, itstill requires a <em>push</em> approach, as inserting just the right amount of samplesper second into the output stream is kept to the developer. Additionally,<code>ScriptProcessorNode</code> has been deprecated without any reasonable cross-browsercompatible alternative available since 2014. Yikes!</p><p><a href="https://blog.mecheye.net/2017/09/i-dont-know-who-the-web-audio-api-is-designed-for/">So whatnow?</a>Luckily, <code>ScriptProcessorNode</code>&apos;s deprecation happened years ago already.  Sincethen, the browser vendors have worked on an alternative, called the<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet"><code>AudioWorklet</code></a>.Encouragingly, it implements what we described above; a pull interface<sup id="a4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup> spawned in a separate thread (hence <code>Worklet</code>) forlag-free audio processing.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s convert our previous code snippet to an <code>AudioWorklet</code>:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">NoiseWorklet</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> <span class="title class_ inherited__">AudioWorkletProcessor</span> {</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="title function_">process</span>(<span class="params">inputs, outputs, parameters</span>) {</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> outputChannel = outputs[<span class="number">0</span>][<span class="number">0</span>];</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">let</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; outputChannel.<span class="property">length</span>; i++) {</span><br><span class="line">      outputChannel[i] = <span class="title class_">Math</span>.<span class="title function_">round</span>(<span class="title class_">Math</span>.<span class="title function_">random</span>());</span><br><span class="line">    }</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  }</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title function_">registerProcessor</span>(<span class="string">&quot;NoiseWorklet&quot;</span>, <span class="title class_">SynthWorklet</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And take a closer look! First, we extend our class with the<code>AudioWorkletProcessor</code> interface class and implement the mandatory<code>process(inputs, output, parameter)</code> function. <code>process</code> allows us to accessall currently available audio <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code> and <em>process</em> them. Wewon&#x2019;t have to add them to the function&#x2019;s <code>return</code> statement, as we&#x2019;remanipulating them by reference. Conveniently, <code>process</code> is called for us by the<code>AudioWorklet</code> every time the output device needs data.</p><p>In terms of understanding, it really helped me think of the <code>AudioWorklet</code> as aring buffer. It&#x2019;s implementation isn&#x2019;t a ring buffer. But that metaphor servedme well for getting a better intuition.</p>        <iframe frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-top-navigation" seamless

the time of writing, the<code>AudioWorklet</code> API is, sadly, only supported by a handful of browsers. A<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/audioworklet-polyfill">polyfill</a> isavailable. As its master branch and npm release were buggy though, I had tosubmit a<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/audioworklet-polyfill/pull/21">PR</a> firstbefore being able to use it. Thanks, Google Chrome team.</p><p>Eventually, I got everything working cross-browser and was able to move onto more exciting things!</p><h3 id="The-Math-of-Audio-Generation">The Math of Audio Generation</h3><p>One of the most daunting tasks of the project was having to deal with the mathto generate audio. After all, the last time I had worked with frequencies wasback in high school physics class and, more recently, in some computer sciencelectures.  In all honesty, though, I had to start from scratch as I hadforgotten almost everything! So for this section, I&#x2019;ll establish a particularformula in great detail as creating it was necessary to come up with afunctioning product.</p><p>I began by <a href="https://hackmd.io/fR86Sw1nSFGdeFmgirt7qw#Math">playing around</a>with sine waves in <a href="http://jsbin.com">jsbin.com</a> and quickly realized that I had to go back evenfurther, by, for example, looking up the definition of a frequency and byresearching the period length of $sin(x)$. Spoiler: It&#x2019;s $2\pi$.</p><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pi8zdfqkbp?embed" style="border:1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>The first <em>actual</em> mathematical problem I encountered was when I tried torender a tone for a given MIDI key dynamically. MIDI keys are tuned byassigning each note to an ascending integer. This integer can then be runthrough a formula to receive the respective frequency in Hertz. Notes exist asfrequency values for waveforms. The MIDI formula I found defined:</p><p>$$f(n) = 2^{\frac{n-69}{12}} \times 440 ,\text{Hz},$$</p><p>&#x201C;So can there be a formula to produce samples given a MIDI key number?&#x201D;, Iasked myself. And even though I was a bit overwhelmed after my firstmathematical research, I was able to come up with something useful.  Given asample rate $\sigma$ and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)">440 Hertzpitch</a>, there&#x2019;s a function$s$ for approximating a sine wave for an $n^{th}$ MIDI key at a time interval$t_n$:</p><p>$$s(t_n) = sin(\frac{2\pi t_n \times 2^{\frac{n - 69}{12}} \times 440}{\sigma})$$</p><p>&#x1F631; It looks complicated! But let&#x2019;s take a closer look to see whether we cansimplify it.  First off, I think it&#x2019;s important to know the intention behinddesigning this function. As I said, it&#x2019;s purpose is to generate sample valuesgiven a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> key number. We just learnedthat there&#x2019;s a formula to generate a frequency value from a MIDI key index. Andin fact, we can see that $f$ is contained in the divisor of $s$.</p><p>$$s(t_n) = sin(\frac{2\pi t_n \times f(n)}{\sigma})$$</p><p>But how can we render a sine wave with a specific frequency?  Well, we alreadyknow that the length of one $sin(x)$ period is $2\pi$. From math class, wemight also remember that we can stretch and compress the period of $sin(x)$ bymultiplying $x$ by a factor $\gamma$, so $g(x) = sin(\gamma x)$.  Meaning, thatwe can define the period length $p$ of $g$ by finding the relation between$\gamma$ and $2\pi$:</p><p>$$p = \frac{2\pi}{| \gamma |}$$</p><p>Knowing this relation already gives us some information on how to produceseveral samples for a sine wave with a given frequency. Let&#x2019;s say we wanted toproduce a 1 Hertz sine wave at a sample rate of 48 kHz for 1 second<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>. Well, then now we&#x2019;ll somehow have to generate 48000samples from $sin(\gamma x)$.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/chunked-sinus-inverted.png" alt="A visual example of chunking a sinus function into tiny sampling-rate-sized bits."></p><p>Two approaches come to mind: Either stretch the period length of $g$ so that wecan simply input integers between $0$ and $48000$ <em>or</em> shrink $x$ relativelysuch that when we&#x2019;re closing in on $48000$ samples generated when we reach$x = 2\pi$ on the x-axis.</p><p>As we&#x2019;ve already defined our period length formula $p$, let&#x2019;s go for the formerapproach. Meaning that if we want our period length to be $p = 48000$ to useascending integers as input for $x$, we can shuffle $p = \frac{2\pi}{| \gamma|}$ to solve for $\gamma$:</p><p>$$\gamma = \frac{2\pi}{p} = \frac{2\pi}{48000} = \frac{\pi}{24000}$$</p><p>Great! Remember, we said earlier that the period of $sin(x)$ could be scaledusing the factor $\gamma$. That means we can now define a function $g$to generate samples:</p><p>$$\begin{aligned}g: \quad&amp; [0, \sigma] \to \N\&amp; x \mapsto sin(\gamma x)\end{aligned}$$</p><p>where we can replace $sin(\gamma x)$ accordingly to introduce the sample rate$\sigma$ (we just renamed $p$) as a factor:</p><p>$$\begin{aligned}g&#x2019;: \quad&amp; [0, \sigma] \to \N\&amp; x \mapsto sin(\frac{2\pi x}{\sigma})\end{aligned}$$</p><p>Generating an arbitrary frequency is now possible too! Say we wanted our sinewave to cycle 10 times per second more, we&#x2019;d simply have to adjust our periodlength by a factor of ten $\gamma = \frac{2\pi \times 10}{48000}$ to receive afrequency at 10 Hertz.</p><p>$$g&#x2019;&#x2019;(t_n) = sin(\frac{2\pi t_n \times 10}{\sigma})$$</p><p>We can just replace this factor by our MIDI-key-to-frequency function $f$:</p><p>$$g&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2019;(t_n) = sin(\frac{2\pi t_n \times 2^{\frac{n - 69}{12}} \times 440}{\sigma})$$</p><p>Et voila, we just created a function that can produce samples at an arbitrarysample rate $\sigma$ from a MIDI key number $n$!</p><p>After creating this first formula, I had passed the localmathematical-insecurity hump, and proudly ventured ahead, trying to solve moreelaborate problems!</p><h3 id="Working-with-WebAssembly-and-C">Working with WebAssembly and C++</h3><p>Finally, I feel like I need to say a few things in this post about WebAssemblyand C++ too. It turns out, that was the most natural part! Yes, being aJavaScript developer, C++ looked foreign at first, and I was a bit scared ofpointers, and the raw-ness C++ radiated. But, overall, it wasn&#x2019;t entirely newterritory for me as I already understood many of its concepts from previousprojects (e.g., working with the shell or Ethereum Solidity). To kickstartdevelopment, I bought &#x201C;Accelerated C++&#x201D; by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo. Iread parts of it but then dove fully into coding. The book is excellent. I canrecommend it!</p><p>The same goes for emscripten and WebAssembly. There are a few gotchas, and I&#x2019;mwriting about one particular in the Appendix of this post. Overall,WebAssembly&#x2019;s tooling is already surprisingly usable and easily integrated intoa standard front end build pipeline.</p><p>I had initially decided on C++ and WASM for the performance boost. Now, I takemuch more joy out being able to separate my code base by concerns nicely.Writing all audio code in C++ and all user interface code in JavaScript led toa loose coupling and nice modularization. I noticed that I not only wrote afully-fledged audio library in C++ through this but also that it&#x2019;s portable toanywhere WebAssembly runs!  That&#x2019;s super cool!</p><h2 id="Lessons-Learned">Lessons Learned</h2><p>WASM Synth turned out to be a great learning experience. Working as a developerin the same field for many years, it&#x2019;s sometimes easy to forget how amazing thebrain reacts to learning new things. In November, after having worked on smartcontracts and decentralized apps for more than a year, I wasn&#x2019;t much confidentanymore in cutting my teeth at math. I felt like I stood no chance insucceeding in writing a program outputting audio. But spending some time doingit, I noticed once again that, like most human-made things, they&#x2019;re limited intheir complexity and that enough time-allocation and intrinsic motivation helpimmensely permeating them.</p><p>The math involved, parts of which I outlined in this post, really put me out ofmy comfort zone. But finally, spending time working towards a practicalsolution helped me fill in the gaps in my knowledge.  In the future, I&#x2019;d liketo make an even more conscious effort involving more of it in my daily coding!</p><p>Lastly, the thesis that many concepts can be mastered playfully by reverseengineering their core problems once again proved to be right, but probably notunchallenged for too long as I&#x2019;m looking for new projects putting me out of mycomfort zone (hire me<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>).</p><h2 id="Resources">Resources</h2><ul><li>WebAssembly<ul><li><a href="https://emscripten.org">emscripten: A toolchain to compile C++ to WASM</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@tdeniffel/pragmatic-compiling-from-c-to-webassembly-a-guide-a496cc5954b8">Step by step guide on how to use emscripten</a></li><li><a href="https://marcoselvatici.github.io/WASM_tutorial/">Tutorial on how to manage memory in WebAssembly</a></li><li><a href="https://gist.github.com/automata/5832104">Example on passing a <code>Float32Array</code> back and forth between JS andC++</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leaningtech.com/cheerp/">Emscripten alternative: cheerp</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/charto/nbind">Embind alternative: nbind</a></li><li><a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Travis.html">Continuous Deployment with emscripten on Travis CI</a></li></ul></li><li>Human-Audio Interaction<ul><li><a href="https://www.audiocheck.net/soundtests_nonlinear.php">The non-linearities of the Human Ear</a></li><li><a href="https://alemangui.github.io/blog//2015/12/26/ramp-to-value.html">Explanation on why we hear a click when audio suddenly stops</a></li></ul></li><li>Audio Engineering:<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies">Piano Key Frequencies</a></li><li><a href="https://www.logicprohelp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=79553">Nice forum post with links to audio engineering resources</a></li><li><a href="https://www.dsprelated.com">Cool website for DSP nerds</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/544gfd/lets_say_i_want_to_design_and_build_synths_as_a/">Career advice on how to become an audio engineer</a></li><li><a href="https://issuu.com/petergoldsborough/docs/thesis">Thesis of someone that also built a synth in C++</a></li><li><a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/course/100/l/l10-synth.pdf">Advanced audio engineering theory slides</a></li><li><a href="https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/table-1-summary-of-midi-message">MIDI protocol specification</a></li><li><a href="http://www.personal.kent.edu/~sbirch/Music_Production/MP-II/MIDI/midi_protocol.htm">Another MIDI protocol specification</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43544357/how-to-connect-web-midi-api-to-native-application-like-ableton-live">Web MIDI and Ableton Live API interaction</a></li><li><a href="https://codepen.io/peteranglea/pen/KZrGxo?editors=1111">Demo of using the Web MIDI API in the browser</a></li><li><a href="http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/">Most useful blog of all!

Notably, when we generated the WebAssembly outputs usingemscripten and they <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/04/loading-wasm">grew bigger than4KB</a>.

But before I explain how, let&#x2019;s take a step backto understand how emscripten&#x2019;s compilation works.</p><p>On installation, emscripten exports a command-line utility called <code>emcc</code> intothe shell. To demonstrate its capabilities, let&#x2019;s try compiling the <code>Hello World</code> example from the beginning of the post:</p><figure class="highlight c++"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="keyword">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="keyword">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;emscripten/bind.h&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> <span class="keyword">namespace</span> emscripten;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">std::string <span class="title">hello</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>{</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;hello world&quot;</span>;</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> Using embind, we can define `hello`&apos;s external name</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS</span>(my_module) {</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">function</span>(<span class="string">&quot;hello&quot;</span>, &amp;hello);</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To make it executable by a browser, we&#x2019;ll use <code>emcc</code> to compile it to a <code>.wasm</code>and a <code>.js</code> file.</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ emcc main.cc --<span class="built_in">bind</span> -WASM=1 -o main.js</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><code>emcc</code> here simply compiles all functions contained in <code>main.cc</code> into a<code>main.wasm</code> file.

But, as I&#x2019;ve mentioned previously, one of the problems now is thatthe <code>AudioWorklet</code>, being spawned in a separate thread with a separate globalscope, won&#x2019;t be aware of emscripten&#x2019;s <code>window.Module</code>. So how do we export codefrom within a Worklet?</p><p>After spending quite some time researching that question, I discovered that theGoogle Chrome Labs team<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/master/audio-worklet/design-pattern/wasm/index.html">recommends</a>transpiling all JavaScript source into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">nativemodules</a>and then simply use ES6&#x2019;s <code>import from</code> syntax. Well, it turns out the JSmodules syntax <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">isn&#x2019;t widely supportedyet</a>,particularly not in <code>Workers</code>, let alone <code>Worklets</code>&#x2026;</p><p><img src="/assets/images/import-support.png" alt></p><p>But luckily, after banging my head another few days against JS modules andother fancy new front end frameworks, I found a surprisingly simple trick.</p><p>I reduce emscripten&#x2019;s outputs to a single <code>.js</code> file that contains the <code>.wasm</code>as base64 string using it&#x2019;s <code>-s SINGLE_FILE=1</code> option. As we need emscripten&#x2019;s<code>.js</code> file to define <code>window.Module</code> in the <code>AudioWorklet</code>&apos;s global scope, Ithen simply append the emscripten JavaScript file with the <code>AudioWorklet</code>&#x2019;JavaScript file to make them configure the same global scope. That allows me toexecute WebAssembly from within a Worklet without using the poorly supported<code>import from</code> syntax. Ultimately, I ended up with the following bash script (oron<a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth/blob/master/scripts/build.sh">GitHub</a>):</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">DIR=<span class="string">&quot;.wasm&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> Generates the .wasm directory if it doesn&apos;t exist yet.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> [ ! -d <span class="variable">$DIR</span> ]; <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">mkdir</span> <span class="variable">$DIR</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">fi</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># NOTE `-std`: To use modern c++11 features like std::tuple and std::vector,</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># we need to enable C++ 11 by passing the parameter to clang through emcc.</span></span><br><span class="line">emcc src/cpp/*.cc \</span><br><span class="line">  -std=c++11 \</span><br><span class="line">  -O1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s WASM=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s BINARYEN_ASYNC_COMPILATION=0 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s SINGLE_FILE=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s MODULARIZE=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  --<span class="built_in">bind</span> \</span><br><span class="line">  -o <span class="variable">$DIR</span>/main.js</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> We concat the emscripten generated js and wasm file with the worklet</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># such that we don&apos;t have to import it later as an es6 module.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(Disclaimer: Dieser Post ist &#x201C;Work in Progress&#x201D;. Ich arbeite noch amperfekten Sauerteigbrot. Die Angaben auf dieser Seite werden sich also sehrwahrscheinlich noch verbessern.)</em></p><h2 id="Anstellgut-herstellen">Anstellgut herstellen</h2><p>Um ein Sauerteigbrot zu backen wird zun&#xE4;chst ein <em>&#x201C;Anstellgut&#x201D;</em> ben&#xF6;tigt.  EinAnstellgut ist einfach vergorenes Mehl und Wasser.  Milchs&#xE4;urebakterien auf derSchale einiger Getreide treiben diese G&#xE4;rung vorran und so entwickelt sich einenat&#xFC;rliche Hefekultur. Verschiedene Mehle (Roggen oder Weizen) produzierenverschiedene Anstellg&#xFC;ter.</p><p>Ein Anstellgut kann sehr einfach &#xFC;ber eine Dauer von f&#xFC;nf Tagen hergestelltwerden. Dazu am besten<a href="https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/916071197018348/Sauerteig.html">diesem</a> Rezeptfolgen.</p><p>Einige Anmerkungen zu diesem Rezept:</p><ul><li><p>Wenn Ihr spontan keinen dauerhaft-warmen Platz in eurer Wohnung finden k&#xF6;nnt,bspw. im Winter, dann stellt euer Gef&#xE4;&#xDF; einfach in euren Backofen und machtdie Lampe an. Dessen Hitze sorgt f&#xFC;r konstante 30&#xB0;C im Ofen und damit f&#xFC;r das idealeKlima f&#xFC;r eine Sauerteigverhefung.</p></li><li><p>Eine Anfangsmenge von 100g Mehl + 100g Wasser produzieren eine MengeAnstellgut. Man kann die Angaben im Rezept also auch gut halbieren.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Anstellgut-am-Leben-erhalten">Anstellgut am Leben erhalten</h2><p>Dar&#xFC;ber wie man das Anstellgut am Besten am Leben erh&#xE4;lt gibt eswiderspr&#xFC;chliche Angaben im Netz. Foodblogger auf Youtube empfehlen meist dasAnstellgut permanent bei Zimmertemperatur zu lagern und mind. 1x am Tag,optimalerweise aber 2x am Tag mit 1EL Mehl + 4 EL lauwarmem Wasser zu f&#xFC;ttern.Alternativ kann das Anstellgut aber anscheinend auch im K&#xFC;hlschrank gelagertwerden und nur 1x die Woche mit 1EL Mehl + 4 EL lauwarmem Wasser gef&#xFC;ttertwerden. Wird es allerdings im K&#xFC;hlschrank gelagert, ist eine <em>&#x201C;Reaktivierung&#x201D;</em>n&#xF6;tig. Hierzu wird, das sich im &#x201C;Winterschlaf&#x201D; befindliche Anstellgut, &#xFC;bereinige Tage mit neuer Nahrung (Mehl + Wasser) versorgt um den eigentlichen Brotteigdann mit einem sehr aktiven Anstellgut zu backen.</p><p>Seine Strategie sollte man also davon abh&#xE4;ngig machen wie spontan oder wie oftman Brot backen m&#xF6;chte.</p><p>Kleiner Tipp: Da eine t&#xE4;gliche F&#xFC;tterung nat&#xFC;rlich Unmengen an Anstellgut &#xFC;berZeit generiert, w&#xFC;rde dass ja auch logischerweise hei&#xDF;en oft Brot backen zum&#xFC;ssen (oder Teile des Anstellgut wegzuwerfen).  Man kann aus dem Anstellgutallerdings auch sehr leckere kleinere Fr&#xFC;hst&#xFC;ckssnacks braten. Also nicht wegwerfen! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVx2oFFptG0">Idee f&#xFC;r einen Snack</a>.</p><h2 id="Sauerteigbrot-backen">Sauerteigbrot backen</h2><p><em>(Dieses Rezept ist WIP. Ich experimentiere noch. Au&#xDF;erdem fehlen mir z.T. auchnoch die richtigen Zutaten.)</em></p><p>Zutaten:</p><ul><li>225g Weizenmehl (Type 550)</li><li>112g Dinkelmehl (Type 1050)</li><li>25g Roggenmehl (Type 1150)</li><li>75g Anstellgut</li><li>190g Wasser</li><li>1 Eigelb</li><li>Salz (nach Gef&#xFC;hl)</li><li>Erbsengro&#xDF;es St&#xFC;ck Hefe (nur wenn Anstellgut noch &#x201C;jung&#x201D; ist)</li></ul><p>Alle oben angebenen Zutaten, au&#xDF;er das Salz in einer gro&#xDF;en Sch&#xFC;ssel mischen.Ihr bekommt einen ziemlich w&#xE4;ssrigen Teig, aber das ist vollkommen OK. Danneinfach mit einer Frischhaltefolie oder einem feuchten Tuch &#xFC;ber Nacht in denK&#xFC;hlschrank packen.</p><p>Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass ihr am n&#xE4;chsten Tag nun versucht den Teigschrittweise glatter zu kneten. Jedoch nicht nur durch Zugabe von Mehl, sondernauch durch die richtige Reifung und Knetmechanik! Den Teig also aus demK&#xFC;hlschrank holen und salzen. Dann  schrittweise ein wenig Weizenmehl hinzugeben, sodass der Teig schleimiger aber fester wird. Ist alles gut verknetet,den Teig bei Raumtemperatur f&#xFC;r 1-2h gehen lassen.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/dough-1.jpg" alt></p><p>Nach der Ruhe, den Teig wieder aus der Sch&#xFC;ssel holen und ihn auf eine saubereFl&#xE4;che &#x201C;werfen und falten&#x201D;.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APEavQg8rMw&amp;t=200s">DiesesVideo</a> erkl&#xE4;rt die Bewegunggut. Nachdem ihr das ca 10min gemacht habt, Teig wieder in Schale und weitergehen lassen. Nach und nach sollte sich die Struktur eures Teigs ver&#xE4;ndert.Er wird glatter und weniger schleimig. Er l&#xE4;sst sich nicht nicht so einfach mehrin die L&#xE4;nge ziehen, etc&#x2026;</p><p>Diese Art von Kneten einige Male wiederholen und zwischendurch Teig immer beiRaumtemperatur gehen lassen, bis ihr einen Teig habt der sch&#xF6;n fluffig undglatt ist.</p><p>Um eine sch&#xF6;ne Kruste beim Backen zu erhalten, m&#xFC;sst ihr nun dieOberfl&#xE4;chenspannung des Teigs erh&#xF6;hen. Um dies zu tun, versucht mit eurenH&#xE4;nden die unteren Seiten des Teiges in dessen untere Mitte zu ziehen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APEavQg8rMw&amp;t=300s">DiesesVideo</a> erkl&#xE4;rt es einwenig.  Ihr m&#xFC;sst nicht genau das im Video machen. Aber spielt einfach einwenig mit dem Teig und dann wird euch schon klar werden wie man mehr Spannungdrauf bringt!  Schlussendlich wollt ihr erreichen, dass auf der zuk&#xFC;nftigenKruste des Brots Teigspannung entsteht und dass der Teig nicht einfach zu einemFladen zusammensackt. Mit dem wiederholten Kneten und gehen lassen baut ihralso Schrittweise die Glutenstruktur des Teigs auf und stabilisiert diese.</p><p>Habt ihr nun also einen sch&#xF6;nen Teig, dann besorgt euch einen Brotkorb odereine Sch&#xFC;ssel in die euer Teig passt und legt ein Tuch hinein. Mehlt das Tuchgro&#xDF;z&#xFC;gig und legt den Teig vorsichtig hinein.</p><p>Achtung: Man kann den Teig entweder mit seinem &#x201C;Saum&#x201D; nach <em>oben</em> oder <em>unten</em>legen.  Beim Backen soll euer Brot ein wenig aufrei&#xDF;en. Das kann entweder miteinem Messerschnitt bewerkstelligt werden, wenn ihr euren Teig mit dem Saumnach oben legt, oder indem des Teigs Saum auf nat&#xFC;rliche Weise im Ofen aufreist.Geschmacksfrage&#x2026;</p><p>Deckt den Teig in der Sch&#xFC;ssel mit dem &#xFC;bergebliebenen Tuch ab und lasst ihnwieder eine Weile gehen.  Irgendwann sollte der Teig dann eine echt&#x201C;gem&#xFC;tliche&#x201D; Konsistenz haben wie ein mega weiches Kissen. Beim vorsichtigendr&#xFC;cken mit einem Finger, sollte der Teig die Kuhle wieder schlie&#xDF;en (sieheVideo). Ist dass der Fall, k&#xF6;nnt ihr schon mal den Ofen anheizen!</p><div style="width:100%;height:480px;background-color:black;text-align:center;">    <video style="height:100%;" controls>      <source src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/03COS0G4L24d9Z6SmEbdXHeIdMy35NqD5VGMDFCrxKprnnwUUuujtQsjjiZ25WUwQKr1yuIBOt4NslifVvxtb73BmTjTi8OguAu1ozi-slBP7UzbazQ_c0vn1VMLIEH3D2n_F1FgN8k=m18" type="video/mp4">    </video></div><p>Um das Brot mit einer knusprigen Kruste zu backen, empfielt sich ein<a href="https://amzn.to/309qvrD">Gusseisentopf mit Deckel</a>. Den Ofen auf volle Hitzeeinstellen und Topf f&#xFC;r 30min vorw&#xE4;rmen.</p><p>Dann muss alles sicher und konzentriert passieren! Den Teig mit einem gemehltenBrett aus eurer Sch&#xFC;ssel st&#xFC;rzen. Den Topf VORSICHTIG mit Handschuhen aus demOfen holen, Teig in den Topf geben, (optional: Narbe einschneiden) und ein wenigWasser mit der Hand an die Seiten des Topfs spr&#xFC;hen um Wasserdampf zu erzeugen.Dann Deckel drauf (ACHTUNG HEISS!) und ab in den Ofen f&#xFC;r 25min.220-240&#xB0;C sind gut. Den Deckel unter keinen Umst&#xE4;nden &#xF6;ffnen.</p><p>Dann nach 25min, Deckel entfernen. Jetzt sollte eigentlich schon die Strukturder Kruste klar erkennbar sein. In den n&#xE4;chsten &#xB1;25min backt ihr dann dieBr&#xE4;une der Kruste. Daf&#xFC;r den Ofen auf 200-220&#xB0;C stellen und regelm&#xE4;&#xDF;ig einenBlick hineinwerfen. Seit ihr mit eurer Kruste zufrieden, einfach das Brot ausdem Topf holen und auf einem Blech k&#xFC;hlen lassen.</p><p>Nicht direkt anschneiden, sondern mehrere Stunden warten um dem Brot Zeit zugeben auszuk&#xFC;hlen.</p><p>Alternativ kann nach erreichen einer tollen Krustenfarbe auch der Ofenausgestellt und die T&#xFC;r angelehnt werden. Anscheinend wird das Brot dann extraknusprig (B&#xE4;ckertrick!).</p><p>Hier meine ersten Ergebnisse:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/bread-1.jpg" alt><img src="/assets/images/bread-2.jpg" alt></p><p>Et voila, ihr habt eurer erstes Sauerteigbrot gebacken!

    <title>Reasons to not ship a PoA network</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This story is written in response to &#x201C;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">Ocean on PoA vs. EthereumMainnet?</a>&#x201D;.In this article, I&#x2019;ll argue for why I think it is a bad choice to ship to aProof-of-Authority network for a project that wants to go permission-less inthe future.</p><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Proof-of-Authority is an algorithm used in blockchains that delivers fastthroughput (tx/s), finality and low fees through a consensus mechanism based onidentity as stake. Both Geth and Parity can easily configured to run on POA. Itallows projects to orchestrate their own networks that run in parallel to theEthereum main chain. POA chains can be configured to be public or private.  POAhas the following positives:</p><ol><li><p>Finality (time for a block to be confirmed), throughput (e.g. tx/s), latencyand fees can be configured, hence compared to the Ethereum main chainperformance is significantly increased.</p></li><li><p>The Ethereum client running the POA can essentially be customized such thatnew use cases can be fulfilled. In the case of POA.network&#x2019;s xDai, Dai is thenative currency. Transaction fees are paid in Dai. Very cool.</p></li><li><p>POA chains benefit Ethereum. Its main chain is not scaling at this point.Even though Plasma (e.g. LeapDAO) and L2 (e.g. Raiden) are shipping, many seesidechains (e.g. POA networks) as a viable scaling mechanism.</p></li></ol><p>I introduce Proof-of-Authority chains and their positives. The next sectiondives into the problems of POA networks.</p><h2 id="Problems">Problems</h2><p>Firstly, I&#x2019;d like to say that there&#x2019;s nothing inherently wrong with shipping ona POA chain per-se. It&#x2019;s more about the intend behind shipping to POA chains.</p><p>Are you orchestrating a POA chain in your company to issue private tokens foryour employees to send around. Great! Are you shipping a public plasma-enabledPOA chain that allows users to exit the chain fairly. Cool!</p><p>I&#x2019;d like to argue, however, that when your goal is to arrive at apermission-less, decentralized and transparent network, you shouldn&#x2019;t ship toPOA first. In the following sections, I&#x2019;ll argue for why that is.</p><h2 id="Security-Guarantees">Security Guarantees</h2><p>Proof-of-Authority in a public setting is a bad choice, as it has differentsecurity guarantees compared to a PoW or PoS network.</p><div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1102455394838822912"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><ol><li><p>Users have to trust in your <a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html">wetcode</a>. Orsimplified: How nodes are run is essentially defined in legal documents. Nodeoperators agree to run the nodes according to these documents. If they don&#x2019;tcomply, they&#x2019;ll face legal issues.  To my knowledge, no precedence has been setin court yet. Note: I&#x2019;m not a lawyer. Building a system with wet code leads,however, to the following properties: (A) It&#x2019;s not permission-less as in:Everybody can, without the incurrence of a cost, to innovate or influence onany part of the infrastructure.(B) It&#x2019;s not necessarily transparent as in:Everybody can follow the decision-making processes. &#xA9; It&#x2019;s not open as in:Everybody can choose to join the network without facing gatekeepers.</p></li><li><p>Identity at stake is not a strong incentive for businesses running nodes.When the only skin-in-the-game is identity, many node operators fail to evenget off the ground. An example: Assume you want to run a POA network that&#x2019;sabout storing data. You get lucky and convince the Internet Archive to run anode on your network. You promise them: &#x201C;By running a node on our network,you&#x2019;ll easily break even by cashing-in on the transaction fees&#x201D;. Now here&#x2019;swhat would happen: The Internet Archive is not in the business of runningblockchains. Their core business model doesn&#x2019;t depend on it. That means, incase they fail to run a node for some reason, they have almost nothing to lose.OK, then say you convince an aspiring blockchain startup to run a node. They&#x2019;rein the business of making money on blockchains! Well, even though they mightrun the risk of suffering a reputation-crisis, that won&#x2019;t affect their bankaccount much. Depending on their business model and product, they might stillbe able to make money. Alright, then let&#x2019;s assume you score one of yourcustomers to run a node. Well in that case, they might actually have vestedinterest in keeping the network up and running. Generally, I&#x2019;d say then: A nodeoperator needs to have significant money at stake (or skin in the game) forthem to be acting in the interests of the network. Hence, PoS or PoW is usuallya good choice in a public setting.</p></li><li><p>Collusion of entities is likely. To join a PoA network, entities will haveto email their public keys back and forth. It makes total sense for them tostay in touch, as they&#x2019;re responsible for keeping the network up and running.That, however, removes the anonymous nature of running a PoW or PoS network.All of a sudden it becomes very easy for entities to collude. Of course,they&#x2019;re legally bound not to, but as we&#x2019;ve seen from the previous points, theymight not be incentivized through stake to act in the interest of the network.</p></li><li><p>Token-bridges are centralized. There&#x2019;s a reason for Plasma to exist.Essentially, it allows users to exit the chain in case of e.g. a (Byzantine)fault. In Plasma, users don&#x2019;t need the permission of any authority to exit.Exits are facilitated through an on-chain contract that&#x2019;s tracking balances.Token-bridges, in contrast, are likely hosted on cloud providers like AWS bythe same organization that&#x2019;s potentially also running a node. This means thatwhen a user transfers money to a POA chain, they have to not only trust theorganizations running the nodes but also organization running the token-bridge!</p></li><li><p>Developers that ship to a POA chain will write different code thandevelopers shipping on a main net. The security guarantees are simplydifferent. On POA, developers can easily take short cuts without spending muchtime thinking about the horrors of adversarial open networks. Speaking from myown experience, when security guarantees change, the code is usually verycostly (time and money) to port.</p></li></ol><p>Now that I discussed the security guarantees of a POA network, let&#x2019;s move on toUX.</p><h2 id="User-and-Developer-Experience">User (and Developer) Experience</h2><p>Running a POA network is going to give users bad experiences for these reasons:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/clippy.jpg" alt></p><ol><li><p>Let&#x2019;s be honest. Today&#x2019;s users struggle to understand what blockchains are.In deploying a separate network (e.g. POA), users will have to additionallylearn what it is. They&#x2019;ll have to manually set the endpoint in Metamask.They&#x2019;ll have to always remember when to change the Metamask endpoint and forwhich application. They&#x2019;ll have to understand what a token-bridge is. They&#x2019;llhave to do the accounting for how much of their money is on the POA net vs.main net. Some apps won&#x2019;t allow setting POA network endpoints. They&#x2019;ll have tounderstand that even though POA addresses look the same as main net addresses,when sending money to a wrong address all their ETH could be gone. Should I goon? Ethereum user interfaces are built for the main net. User education happenson the main net. In terms of UX, <a href="https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1099782348562870273">POA networks are the FTP protocols ofblockchains</a>.</p></li><li><p>Smart contract composability. IMO, the Ethereum killer feature. Essentially,the reason for why we have DeFi today. While token-bridges allow forcross-chain value transfer, transfer of state isn&#x2019;t possible <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/why-smart-contracts-are-not-feasible-on-plasma/2598">and likely won&#x2019;tbe in thefuture</a>.I&#x2019;d like to make this extra clear: A contract deployed on a POA network willnot be able to interact with a contract on the main network through state (e.g.calling functions). Yes, value can be sent through a token-bridge and thatmeans one could potentially send ETH/ERC20 from: POA contract -&gt; token-bridge-&gt; e.g. Uniswap. Most DeFi requires the calling of contract&#x2019;s methods, however.Not having smart contract composability leads to the following: (1) Developerswill not be able to plug into your contract APIs unless they also ship on yourPOA network. (2) Your projects will not profit as much from open-sourcecollaboration, assuming most developers want to ship on the main net.</p></li><li><p>POA prohibits layer 2 scaling. Most layer 2 scaling solutions are developedspecifically to solve the problems of the Ethereum main net. On a POA (andsidechain), you&#x2019;ll not directly profit when these technologies get rolled out.Instead you&#x2019;ll have to spend significant time and money to customize them.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Misc">Misc.</h2><ol><li>Building tools and deploying a POA network is work. In fact, it&#x2019;s adistraction. The money you spend on customizing and deploying your POA will bewasted once you ship to main net. As outlined before, it will put the engineersin the wrong mind set. It&#x2019;s distracting them from shipping the best productthey possibly can, I&#x2019;d argue.</li></ol><h2 id="Solutions">Solutions</h2><p>I outline a few possible solutions that remove POA (but not side chains) fromthe equation.</p><ol><li><p>Ship to main net and wait for e.g. ETH 2.0/Polkadot. Least costly. Bestsecurity guarantees. Bad performance. UX will be painful but improving rapidlyas you can profit from the community making progress (e.g. meta-transactions).Full focus on shipping product though. No distractions. You&#x2019;ll profit fromcomposability and projects integrating.</p></li><li><p>Ship to main net and investigate alternatives to POA that offer bettersecurity guarantees to users (e.g. Loom Network is shipping dPoS &#x2014; nodeoperators actually lose money when they misbehave). Not that costly, I imagine.Better performance than main net. Better security guarantees. UX will be sameas POA. You won&#x2019;t profit from main net innovation as much.</p></li><li><p>Ship to main net and investigate Plasma as an alternative. Most costly andcomplex, I imagine. Good performance. Better security guarantees than POA.You&#x2019;ll profit from the innovation going into Plasma. UX will be as bad as POAbut through community innovation will increase at rapid pace.</p></li><li><p>Ship to main net and consider L2 via e.g. Raiden. Costly as contracts haveto be adjusted. Good performance. Better security guarantees than POA.Innovation in UX through community at rapid pace.</p></li></ol><p>All the solutions outlined come as &#x201C;off the shelf&#x201D; to some degree and withsecurity guarantees similar to main net. They&#x2019;re all more or less shippingtoday.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this post I argue for why shipping a public POA network is a bad choice whenplanning to go permission-less in the future by highlighting the security andUX challenges users will face. I give alternative solutions to POA.</p><p><em>(This article was originally posted on<a href="https://medium.com/@timdaub/why-you-shouldnt-ship-to-a-poa-network-7e2b5aa83aa9">medium.com</a>)</em></p>]]></content>
