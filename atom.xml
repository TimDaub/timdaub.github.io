They argue that by allowing voters to expresspreference intensity and introducing a social cost for voters, the votemore accurately reflects the populous opinion on a set of choices.</p><p>On March 16, 2022, with Hito Steyerl, <a href="https://decentralala.com">DoD</a> and <a href="http://studiobonn.io">Studiobonn</a>, inspired by Weyl et al.&apos;sidea, we conducted a quadratic vote on the future governance mechanismsof Bundeskunsthalle, a federally-backed art exhibition hall. To allowaudience participation, we handcrafted <a href="https://strikedao.com">strikedao.com</a> (<a href="https://github.com/strikedao/strikedao.com">source code</a>), aminimum viable quadratic voting app.</p><p>Having been the main developer behind the application, and since I&apos;mcurrently studying Weyl et al.&apos;s book, with this post, I&apos;ll name severalconceptional user experience problems we ran into duringimplementation.</p><p>Before I dive in, however, if you want to educate yourself onquadratic voting, I recommend looking at RadicalExchange&apos;s concept pageon <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/">quadraticvoting</a> as I won&apos;t really go into explaining how it works.</p><h2 id="problem-1-a-social-cost-for-voting-isnt-intuitive.">Problem #1:A Social Cost For Voting Isn&apos;t Intuitive.</h2><p>In their 2018 book, Weyl et al. introduce the benefits of having asocial cost by telling the story of a town and its nearby power plantemitting pollutants into the air. Their argument: Depending on theindividual&apos;s intensity of preference, a cost should incur for how muchthey each demand the plant&apos;s pollution to decrease assuming everyone&apos;selectricity bills dropping.</p><p>For example, in a town with many pollution-tolerant citizens thatprefer cheap energy, Nils, who is running a laundry and is stronglyanti-air pollution, shall bear the (quadratic) cost of change inrelation to his peers. Said differently, he should pay the nominaleconomic cost of his peers&apos; higher electricity bill that would resultfrom lowering the town&apos;s pollution.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/cost-of-externality.png" alt="A really sloppy drawing of the externality geometry of Nils. For a better one, buy Weyl&apos;s book."><figcaption aria-hidden="true">A really sloppy drawing of theexternality geometry of Nils. For a better one, buy Weyl&apos;sbook.</figcaption></figure><p>While, actually, this example motivates the point for introducing asocial cost to preference voting well, I&apos;d say it&apos;s much harder to grokin real-life voting scenarios.</p><p>Not only isn&apos;t it always possible to directly identify a concreteeconomic cost for each proposal in a voting process, but also, if we&apos;dvote only on choices with perfect information, we may not have to votein the first place. Things would just take care of themselves.</p><p>My point being that preference voting on choices isn&apos;t always easilyreducable to a nominal economic problem. Particularly not thesedays.</p><h2 id="learning-to-differentiate-between-voting-credits-and-votes-is-hard.">Learningto differentiate between &quot;voting credits&quot; and &quot;votes&quot; is hard.</h2><p>However, here&apos;s where I see the first actual user experience problemwith quadratic voting: Introducing &quot;voting credits&quot; and mapping themonto votes through a mathematical function is where we abandon many.</p><p>In my personal experience, asking people to &quot;forget&quot; all about votingand then introducing &quot;voting credits&quot; that only become votes afterrunning them through a quadratic cost function <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c(x) = {x}^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">c</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is a huge challenge. Honestly,and without wanting to sound rude, most people probably have longforgotten what a quadratic function looks like or that it&apos;s just a moreelegant way of saying: We&apos;re going to square some numbers. Those schooldays have been a while back...</p><p>But additionally, I want to stress the difficulty of motivating theintroduction of &quot;voting credits&quot; - which even I am having troubleunderstanding at times. The problem is only exemplified by thebackwardness of math itself.</p><h2 id="the-math-of-quadratic-voting-is-literally-backward">The Math OfQuadratic Voting is Literally Backward</h2><p>As humans of the twenty-first century, we&apos;re well-versed inallocating budgets and spending &quot;credits&quot; everywhere. E.g., if we have5&#x20AC; in our wallets, we are easily capable of spending them on oneespresso, one cappuccino, and one piece of cake - if all those end upcosting roughly five euros.</p><p>But with quadratic voting, and since we&apos;re used to having naturalnumbers as voting outcomes, the cost function is reversed.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum is a better publishing platform than any of its web2counterparts. Like Facebook or Twitter.</p><p>It&apos;s globally distributed, has no geographical headquarters, and hasnobody in charge. Ethereum won&apos;t delete, hide or algorithmicallyreshuffle posts. Its newsfeed is the block order, but it won&apos;t<em>block</em> certain politically-loaded topics. Its operators&apos;incentive is making money through transaction inclusion, not runningads. Ethereum rejects the concept of content curation andmoderation.</p><p>Publishing on Ethereum is as close as it gets to shouting your wordsin the air when surrounded by others. Ethereum is the publishingplatform we deserve.</p><h2 id="the-tale-of-three-webs">The Tale of Three Webs</h2><p>There&apos;s the tale of the web&apos;s evolution among people in the industry.You&apos;ve probably heard it a million times by now, but how it goes is thatweb1 was read-only, and web2 added publishing or &quot;write.&quot; With web3emerging through the advances of distributed systems, everyone has tohave their opinion about it - <a href="/2020/09/08/web3/">meincluded</a>.</p><p>But Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Signal, published his &quot;<a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">(...)first impressions of web3</a>&quot; at the beginning of this year and caughtmy attention. A central thesis of his piece is that &quot;People don&apos;t wantto run their own servers, and never will.&quot; The story he relays is thatweb2&apos;s platforms emerged to fill the web1 users&apos; desire to stop runningtheir own infrastructure.</p><p>And to unpack that, I want to empathize with his viewpoint.</p><p>Running web servers in times of web1 was indeed truly cumbersome.There were no cloud providers; internet connections were shit, and webdevelopment tooling as we know it wasn&apos;t existent. Moxie makes thisargument as it fits his central thesis that the &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj3YFprqAr8">ecosystem ismoving</a>.&quot; He&apos;s saying: We&apos;re already upgrading the web with protocolsthat omit to collect (meta)data to solve &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Social_Dilemma&amp;oldid=1076198943">TheSocial Dilemma</a>.&quot; The product they publish, the Signal messenger,e.g., <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/">providedno meaningful data to the Central District of California</a>, statingthat &quot;Signal still knows nothing about you, but inexplicably thegovernment continues to ask [us].&quot;</p><p>So, by upgrading from web 2.0 to web 2.1, as Moxie suggests - can wepack up and move on from building cryptocurrencies? He solves the socialdilemma? Is that it?</p><h2 id="the-public-facing-web2">The Public-Facing Web2</h2><p>The problem with Moxie&apos;s behavior and article is that he didn&apos;t stayin his lane. Signal isn&apos;t truly a &quot;web2 platform&quot;, in the sense ofFacebook, Twitter, and Telegram.</p><p>Within a chat on Signal, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Twitter, orany other instant messenger, for that sake, nobody gets centrallymoderated or shut down. I&apos;d assume you can speak freely in privateconversations. The problem being in that case, who else is reading theconversation? Talking to you, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/government-agent-watching-me">Mr.FBI Agent</a>. Here, privacy is at risk, and Signal&apos;s protocol is abrilliant fix.</p><p>However, I&apos;d like to argue that instant messaging (except for howTelegram implements it) isn&apos;t really contested as a societal problem.The societal problem that leads people to give conference talks, go onpodcasts and write blog posts is big tech&apos;s active curation of publicdiscourse on newsfeeds. Case in point: &quot;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-facebook-instagram-temporarily-allow-calls-violence-against-russians-2022-03-10/">Facebookallows Ukraine war posts urging violence against invadingRussians</a>.&quot;</p><h2 id="taking-on-responsibility">Taking On Responsibility</h2><p>Hence, rhetorically scrutinizing once again Moxie&apos;s original thesisif &quot;People don&apos;t want to run their own servers, and never will,&quot; I&apos;dlike to assume that in the general case: <strong>It&apos;sincorrect</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, would I, as a nerd, be asked to administrate a server runningthe Signal protocol for friends and myself: I&apos;d say &quot;Yes&quot; immediately.It&apos;s because: &quot;Signal still knows nothing about [us],&quot; and so it&apos;d seemunlikely having to take on substantial responsibility. But Signal alsodoesn&apos;t host a publicly accessible digital room as, e.g., Telegram&apos;schannels or Facebook&apos;s newsfeed do.</p><p>Would I want to contribute to hosting the Facebook newsfeed, and forthat sake: Would I want to take on responsibility for shaping publicdiscourse?</p><p>Back in the old web1 days, people had guestbooks and comment sectionson their pages: Nowadays they don&apos;t - but it&apos;s not because nobody wantsto host their servers: It&apos;s because of the heavy responsibility of doingso. It must be the reason they say that &quot;<a href="https://mux.com/blog/you-either-die-an-mvp-or-live-long-enough-to-build-content-moderation/">youeither die an MVP or live long enough to build content moderation</a>,&quot;and I believe that&apos;s true.</p><h2 id="ethereum-is-the-newsfeed-we-deserve">Ethereum is the newsfeed wedeserve</h2><p>And so that&apos;s why web3 is taking off. That&apos;s why it has fans and nodeoperators. Sure, it isn&apos;t very pleasant running an Ethereum full nodeand currently costs me roughly 130 EUR/month. But it guarantees thatworldwide, whoever wants can publish whatever they want on-chain if theyjust pay the transaction costs.</p><p>&quot;<a href="/2022/02/28/smart-contracts-are-programmable-commons/">SmartContracts are the Programmable Commons</a>.&quot; While traditional web2platforms like Facebook are built on the assumptions of privately ownedproperty and require taking on responsibility, Ethereum is collectivelymaintained, hosted, administrated, and run by everyone.</p><p>There&apos;s no sorting for relevancy or increasing ad impression revenue.There&apos;s no moral or social dilemma stemming from having total controlover others&apos; communication. Node operators may be biased, but &quot;Ethereumis neutral.&quot;</p><div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1496695587495981056"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>That&apos;s why Ethereum is the newsfeed we deserve.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&apos;s smart contracts allow developers, for the first time inhistory, to build ownership experiences residing in the commons.Traditional cloud platforms like Amazon&apos;s AWS or Microsoft&apos;s Azure arebuilt on the assumption of privately owned property and hence alsotaking on responsibility and liability in computing. A rented serverrunning a program orchestrated by an individual will always necessitateseeking those to be held accountable.</p><p>Decentralized smart contracts, owned and controlled by no singlenatural or juristic person, hosted by no particular individual, do notlook or feel like private property. They are collectively maintained,hosted, administrated, and run; they ARE the commons.</p><p>Deploying a simple stateful contract on Ethereum that carries nocodified notion of specifically-added ownership is not hosted by anyonein particular. Its deployment can be orchestrated such that noindividual could be observed as &quot;the deployer.&quot; A contract&apos;s existenceis solidified through its data&apos;s block inclusion. Its data iscontinuously and neutrally made available as part of all data beingon-chain available. No one individual could be observed as the operatoror controller of such a contract.</p><p>A contract&apos;s execution is not directly controllable. Unlessspecified, its lifetime is not limited. A message call invokes acontract&apos;s public and external functions. Its computation is redundantlyrun by any individual block producer on the network. Not by some, but byanyone participating in the network.</p><p>No individual block producer or full node executes the message call.Though transactions are prioritized through payment, all nodes areobligated to return the one deterministic result. There is no oneindividual responsible, liable, or accountable for delivering on thecall.</p><p>Ethereum&apos;s smart contracts are the programmable commons as they trulyallow property to transcend into the common realm. Since smart contractsare, as outlined above, an instrument residing in the commons, givingthem ownership over other property allows it to transcend into thecommons too.</p><p>Properly configured common ownership contracts do not allow propertyescaping into private possession either. Physical and commonly-ownedproperty configured through paper contracts, on the contrary, allowtranscendence into the hands of private owners.</p><p>Arguably, a stone on the bottom of the Atlantic ocean is commonlyowned by all creatures on earth capable or willing to exercise thecommon property concept. Similarly, in some countries, at least, so iswater. This quality not only implies shared responsibility for theobjects in question, it also asks for mutually-assumed liability.Indeed, shared property requires normative behavior.</p><p>It means that no one single co-owner of a partially owned watersource is entitled to make decisions. At the risk of polluting the watersource, all interactions with it require normative action, as the onlyacceptable behavior is one that can potentially become a mutuallyagreed-upon rule for all.</p><p>If they dare, the private owner, both legally and morally, is capableof polluting their possession: the water source. If they, through theirwill, decide to do it, and if it is their property, we have agreed toallow it under private property law.</p><p>It is important to realize how different common ownership experiencesare and how little practical governing experience we all have. It isalso important to understand that the transcendence of property betweenthe two realms is, as already claimed prior, a possibility.</p><p>Nobody&apos;s stone can become someones. Moral, law, history, and recoursehelp define over time who owns what. On Ethereum, that is similar butdifferent.</p><p>Here, given its pristine unregulated nature, smart contractdevelopers are not necessarily bound to use the standard societalconstructs of private property. As smart contracts themselves symbolizealready an instrument in the realm of the commons, and since neither thelegal system nor recourse is strictly required or capable of governingpossession, blockchain property may never be directly controllable,albeit logically still exist outside of a vacuum.</p><p>Besides private property, common property or new forms like Harbergerproperty, code, similar to prose and imagination, can extend towards anyshape or form of non-skeuomorphic property.</p><p>No matter the view of legal advisors on the subject matter and theirdesire to seek skeuomorphic comparisons for rational regulation: Today,with systems like Ethereum, completely new forms of digital (andatomic?) ownership experiences are possible that will necessarilychallenge the fundamental assumptions of price discovery, evaluation,supply and demand economics, and the legal system.</p>]]></content>

Today, I hadthe honor of meeting with members of the <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/partial-common-ownership/">RadxChangeHarberger tax working group</a>. In the following sections, I want toiterate on a topic that I deemed relevant and important in today&apos;sconversation that nicely ties into my previous post on creatingnon-skeuomorphic ownership experiences.</p><h2 id="the-problem-of-private-property">The Problem of PrivateProperty</h2><p>Harberger taxes, a topic extensively discussed in &quot;Radical Markets&quot;and the Radical Exchange movement, is a mechanism for more fairlypricing a particular scarce property. The book features an example ofthe government in California trying to build a high-speed rail from LosAngeles to San Francisco. And facing the problem of real estate ownerstaking advantage of their monopolistic property possession when asked bythe railway constructor to sell their homes.</p><p>Weyl and Posner argue that the last remaining property owner alongthat high-speed railroad positions themselves monopolistic as, assumingthe necessity for a straight rail, they can leverage their property&apos;sgeography to ask for a price almost as high as it&apos;d take to plan andexecute an alternative route or whatever would be the total cost of theentire high-speed rail project failing.</p><p>Within a private property owner&apos;s mind, the case is clear: Sell or ashigh as possible or drag the whole process out to increase leverage.</p><h2 id="understanding-harberger-properties">Understanding HarbergerProperties</h2><p>To address this problem, Weyl and Posner argue that a different wayof pricing real-estate in California could help build the high-speedrail project more efficiently. Their suggestion is based on the ideathat each real estate is continuously available for sale and where theowner is voluntarily setting a self-assessed price on which they have toadditionally pay a reoccurring percentual fee: The &quot;Harberger tax.&quot;</p><p><img src="https://github.com/rugpullindex/libharberger/raw/master/assets/harbergerschema.jpg"></p><p>If, e.g., there was a 0.2% Harberger tax on California homes and anowner would self-assess their property to be $100k, they&apos;d be requiredto pay <span class="katex-display"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>100000</mn><mo>&#x2217;</mo><mn>0.02</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>200</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">100000 *0.02 = 200</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">&#x2217;</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">.</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">0</span></span></span></span></span> USD worth of Harberger taxes. Interestingly, both theproperty being continuously on sale and the tax needing to be paidincentivizes the owner to evaluate their property at the possibly mostaccurate price.</p><p>If they&apos;d assess it too low, since it&apos;s always on sale, it could beeasily picked up by a property flipper while it&apos;d incur unsustainablereoccurring Harberger taxes if it were priced too high.</p><h2 id="harberger-property-forks-private-property.">Harberger Propertyforks Private Property.</h2><p>What I deemed to be an interesting talking point in today&apos;s meetingon Harberger taxes at ETHDenver, however, started as a discussion aroundmeasuring a property&apos;s turnover rate. Given that setting a propertyclass&apos;s tax rate well may have to be adjusted dynamically; one argumentwas that naturally, a property owner always has the lowest possible taxrate at interest.</p><p>It makes sense intuitively too. While arguably living in a &quot;Harbergeruniverse,&quot; so a place where all property is priced using Harberger taxescreates meaningful collective outcomes, a rational individualunderstanding the monopolistic qualities of private property must wantto either lower or abolish their Harberger tax as it&apos;d mean being ableto increase their property&apos;s value (without incurring higher total taxcosts) or improving their uncertainty of continued ownership.</p><h2 id="harberger-escapes">&quot;Harberger Escapes&quot;</h2><p>So in that case, and since we&apos;re heavily hypernormalized in a privateproperty society, a fenced-off Harberger Property system that, e.g., canbe created with smart contracts on Ethereum would always end up havingto make sure that property owners don&apos;t &quot;escape&quot; from the &quot;Harbergeruniverse&quot; into the realm of &quot;private property.&quot;</p><p>The California railway example goes like this: Assume you&apos;re the lastCalifornian property owner, but the state had prior agreed-uponHarberger pricing. However, through a loophole in the law, you&apos;re ableto change the property owner&apos;s name on the deed of ownership. Youunderstand the private property principles, and you&apos;re a degen, so yougive Wall Street a call and explain to them your situation: You tellthem that you&apos;re the last person on the high-speed rail needing to sellthe property: But you don&apos;t have enough capital to sustain pricing ithigh until the railway construction company gives in to yourdemands.</p><p>In that case, Wall Street might give you a loan, or since yourproperty is &quot;alwaysonsale&quot;, they might buy it from you right away for ahigher than usual rate, assuming they can further increase pressure onthe railroad constructor.</p><p>Now, in the constructed case of a wet-code law that allows forappropriate recourse, that may mean that indeed the property will end upbeing priced better under Harberger law than as private property.</p><p>However, e.g., Harberger properties implemented on Ethereum, that maynot be the case. And that&apos;s where the group today had, I think, a slightdisagreement.</p><h2 id="is-erc721-compatible-with-harberger-properties">Is ERC721compatible with Harberger Properties?</h2><p>Consider the case where we create an ERC721 NFT that is continuouslyon sale using Harberger tax mechanics but still is entirely compliantwith ERC721. In that case, e.g., that <code>transferFrom</code> methodmight allow sending the deed of ownership from one account to another.But, it also allows an owner to make an internal accounting transferwhere they sent their property from one of their accounts toanother.</p><p>We want to allow an owner to send their deed of ownership from oneaddress to another as, e.g., their keys get compromised. Although, this&quot;maintenance functionality&quot; may then easily be abused by owners wantingto &quot;Harberger escape&quot; into private property: By selling their propertyover the counter for more than what it is worth to a buyer, the sellerprofits from the premium while the buyer profits from lower taxes.</p><p>While it is true that this deal may be fragile as the information theprivate agreement was based on could easily leak, and hence the propertypicked up by a sneaky arbitrageur, I still believe &quot;Harberger escapes&quot;into private properties could become a reality.</p><p>I understand my attempt at playing devil&apos;s advocate is not ideal yet.However, I feel that it&apos;s rather just a challenge of finding awell-enough positioned new owner with just enough opposed interest inHarberger-taxed property. E.g., if it wasn&apos;t enough to keep the deal&apos;sbasis a secret, then, e.g., a malicious buyer&apos;s hedge could be some betdirectly opposed to the railroad company&apos;s success: e.g., shorting itsstock.</p><h2 id="do-we-need-an-erc721-2.0-for-harberger-properties">Do we need anERC721 2.0 for Harberger Properties?</h2><p>Despite all this skepticism, I&apos;m still a firm believer in the idea,while I believe it&apos;ll have to carefully be implemented as a fenced-offsystem for it to work. An elegant solution I have not explored furthercame from the <a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">Geoweb Network</a>team that suggested only ever allowing a smart contract to truly&quot;privately possess&quot; the property.</p><p>It&apos;s because what this would allow is anyone being always able to&quot;pick up&quot; the property, particularly in the case of leaked alpha.However, it&apos;d mean restricting the ERC721 token&apos;s<code>transferFrom</code> function only to be called by the Harbergertax management contract. Assuming marketplaces like Opensea wouldrecognize this limitation in the collection, it wouldn&apos;t pose a problem,whereas I still see the issue of not complying with ERC721.</p><p>There&apos;s an implicit private property assumption in ERC721&apos;s<code>transferFrom</code> function that&apos;d always allow the current ownerto send the token to another address. Interfaces like Metamask andOpensea are built with those assumptions in mind. While technicallyapproving the transfer with the managing Harberger contract may be apossibility, I still believe that to cause trouble and confusion.</p><p>Given our hypernormalized suffering and our need to further buildnon-skeuomorphic ownership models, I&apos;d like to argue herein that weshould look beyond ERC721 and ERC1155 and do everything necessary toabandon the assumptions of private property in all Ethereuminfrastructure. Ethereum (and its standards) should &quot;get weird,&quot; and itshouldn&apos;t be opinionated about property laws: Those should beprogrammable or configurable.</p><p>Today, I feel grateful for having been given a chance to participatein this mind-opening meeting and work on such awesomeintellectually-challenging work. It&apos;s great to be here, Denver!</p><h2 id="see-also">See also:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/rugpullindex/libharberger">github.com/rugpullindex/libharberger</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&apos;m writing these lines with severe dark circles induced by +7hjetlag and intense crypto conference networking. Today&apos;s my second dayin Denver, and by being an early bird, I got the chance to participatein Gitcoin&apos;s ETHDenver satellite event called &quot;Schelling Point.&quot; In thispost, as in the one yesterday, I reflect on my experiences at theevent.</p><p>I&apos;ll start with my day&apos;s first highlight, which was the building theevent took place. Called &quot;the Sports Castle,&quot; and indeed seeminglypassing the &quot;castle glance,&quot; is a building on Denver&apos;s capitol hillthat, on closer internal inspection, turns out to be a converted parkinggarage-made event venue.</p><p>While the first floor&apos;s low ceiling makes for a partially awkwardviewing experience of the stage, the former vehicle ramps and thebuilding&apos;s compactness create an interesting event vibe. Walking throughcheaply assembled crypto startup booths in a former parking garage mademy mind wander.</p><p>But Am I now doing architecture reviews? Yes and no. I think I wantto mention the space&apos;s feel as I found it to be comically opposed to thespace&apos;s ascribed value. I&apos;ve overheard today that Ethereum&apos;s chain aloneharbors over $2T in assets today: And still, its community meets in anabandoned parking garage.</p><p>More importantly, though, this image of technical misappropriation,although that term may be too negatively connotated in the Englishlanguage, provides an interesting segue into some conversations Ioverheard today: Namely that the crypto-verse and particularly Ethereumwith its programmable money allows developers to create non-skeuomorphicdigital experiences. So if in the real world, a parking garage canbecome a crypto event&apos;s venue, why shouldn&apos;t Bored Apes take Rolex&apos;splace?</p><p>This idea was further underlined by the event&apos;s participants and someconversations I had. While there&apos;s a mutual understanding that buyingdigital sneakers for a metaverse pod is rather skeuomorphic, that lineof thinking isn&apos;t representative of the fact that on the metaverse, youcan be anything: even a boat that chooses to wear Nike&apos;s.</p><p>But it&apos;s true: Within the blockchain, given our hyper normalizedsuffering, we&apos;ve re-built private property laws skeumorphically. User&apos;sdon&apos;t have to occupy the property to continue owning it; it can&apos;t andmust not be taken away forcefully. The individual and their consentultimately determine pricing before the sale. As a Harberger maximalist,what comes to mind then is that we&apos;ve reimplemented private propertymonopolies without truly ever questioning them. So indeed, it is time todare and design non-skeuomorphism.</p><p>I, for one, appreciate the call for &quot;getting weird(er)&quot; [again] andthe renewed commitment of the space to both empirical test andtheoretically research what works. Besides that, I didn&apos;t take much morefrom Vitalik&apos;s talk. He should have mentioned, though, that what they&apos;veall done with shipping ETH2.0 is a great example of both empirical andtheoretical work going hand-in-hand. Kudos to everyone that worked onETH2. You&apos;re about to make it!</p><p>Today&apos;s event at Denver&apos;s Sports Castle was incredibly intense andworthwhile the visit. I hate to reduce it to the following, but aftertwo years of not making the crazy crypto conference mingling experience,I can proudly say that today, though I&apos;m incredibly exhausted, I feelaccomplished and happy for having been able to participate. This feltgreat!</p><p>And in case they&apos;ve been recorded and will be released online, I canrecommend the following talks:</p><ul><li>Vitalik&apos;s keynote speech on empirical and theoretical work</li><li>Beth Mccarthy&apos;s &quot;Building regenerative culture.&quot;</li><li>The panel on &quot;Regenerative Cryptoeconomics.&quot;</li><li>Glen Weyl&apos;s talk on &quot;Plurality.&quot;</li></ul><p>If you&apos;ve enjoyed reading this post, consider checking outyesterday&apos;s, too, &quot;<a href="/2022/02/16/ethdenver-buidl-week-day-one/">My First Day atBUIDLWEEK &amp; ETHDENVER.</a>&quot;</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I arrived in Denver, Colorado, yesterday afternoon, and I plan toattend ETHDenver and all its satellite events. Today was my first day atthe venues; Strictly speaking, I was at &quot;BUIDL week,&quot; the event leadingup to ETHDenver. The following post is a summary of my impressions.</p><h2 id="covid-policy">COVID policy</h2><p>Let&apos;s start with the most relatable topic: viral infection risk.Today, I learned that the US is pretty chill on this topic compared tomy hometown Berlin in Germany.</p><p>Before receiving a wrist band, every attendee is run through asupervised antigen self-test. Admission only proceeds if it&apos;s negative.Vaccination isn&apos;t required. Testing procedures are conducted by acompany called &quot;APEX Diagnostics.&quot; Despite some dystopic (&amp;unconfirmed) claims on Twitter, I&apos;m expecting the DNA on my swab not togo into the next best genome database.</p><p>But speaking of chill COVID measures, I&apos;ve been told that theColorado government abandoned the mask-wearing mandate some weeksago.</p><p>While I find it awesome to mingle in the crowds like in pre-pandemictimes, not wearing masks indoors makes me anxious. I&apos;m just so used toit. Anyways, I came here aware of the risks, and I&apos;m grateful forparticipating in a conference after now two years of online-only eventsand social distancing.</p><h2 id="venues">Venues</h2><p>ETHDenver has an interesting layout of venues. The event is held inmaybe two or three blocks in the capitol hill district of Denver.Although it wasn&apos;t immediately clear to me, it seems that many of thevenues are temporarily converted nightclubs and bars. I particularlyloved the pub-ish vibe that &quot;Broadway 1134&quot; gave me. Cozy andlaid-back.</p><p>But, being severely jetlagged, I also got confused about the variousbuildings. Particularly since every other building not hosting officialETHDenver events is still hosting some different blockchain protocol&apos;sevent. That&apos;s why strolling down Denver&apos;s &quot;Broadway,&quot; I suddenly foundmyself at &quot;AlgoRanch,&quot; a companion event by Algorand.</p><h2 id="people">People</h2><p>I realized today that what I appreciate most about conferences is theopportunity to meet and get to know completely random people quickly.Coming from cold-hearted Berlin to a US conference is just sorefreshing. Everyone here is so outgoing, friendly, and an ice-breakingexpert. I&apos;ve already had some entirely random but meaningfulconversations, and I appreciate that!</p><h2 id="talks">Talks</h2><p>I haven&apos;t attended any talks yet. I listened with one ear to what wassaid at 1134 by Foresight Institute, but that&apos;s about it. I&apos;m searchingfor serious technical talks: Let me know if you have suggestions for theupcoming days.</p><h2 id="denver">Denver</h2><p>My first impression of Denver is that it&apos;s completely different fromwest and east coast cities like NY or SF/LA. Is its climate continental?I&apos;d argue so as I had strolled around downtown yesterday with just apullover while there&apos;s currently a snow storm jamming the city&apos;sinfrastructure.</p><p>Speaking of structure: I love the grid US cities have implementedwith streets and avenues. Also, cars drive much slower than in Berlin.At least in downtown, it seems that also helps with reducing noisepollution. Cool!</p><p>I&apos;m impressed by Denver&apos;s skyscrapers, but in my mind, they don&apos;t addup. This morning, to get a coffee, I saw all the tall buildings but nopeople around them. How&apos;s that possible? Shouldn&apos;t a 20 story buildingcause some hefty pedestrian traffic?</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>That&apos;s all I have for today. I&apos;m planning to do more of these postsduring the event. If you have suggestions of other topics, I shouldcover, please reach out to me. And if you want to meet in person, pleasealso get in touch!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Optimism describes a social behavior whereby individuals or groupstend to favor evaluating a subject&apos;s positive sides rather than seekingto balance their view by also considering negatives.</p><p>We deem optimism as toxic when its application or incidence occursexcessively or as a form of denial of a skewed perception ofreality.</p><h2 id="the-itch-of-positivity">The Itch of Positivity</h2><p>Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartleby,_the_Scrivener">I&apos;d prefernot to</a>, I want to start this essay with a personal anecdote, namelywhen I first helped co-create a platform for upvoting submissions inuniversity. For a portal to collect and discuss privacy patterns, as afrontend developer, I helped set up <a href="https://privacypatterns.eu">privacypatterns.eu</a> whose supposedgoal was to bubble up the best patterns for improved privacy.</p><p>Rather quickly, a discussion ensued around the concepts of upvotingand downvoting patterns with my colleagues responsible for maintainingthe database.</p><p>Already seven years ago, surprisingly, we were all intimatelyfamiliar with sites like Facebook and Reddit that served as role modelsfor our site. We knew that FB&apos;s &quot;Like&quot; acted as an upvote-only function,whereas Reddit allowed users to express nominal negativity too.</p><p>But apart from getting lost in thought, I still remember notinvolving myself much in the conversation as I found it to be over myhead. And I can&apos;t say for sure if the following seven years of softwareengineering make it any easier thinking about this topic today.</p><p>I have, however, managed to curate a persevering itch telling me thatexclusive positivity on social media platforms must lead to detrimentaloutcomes. And recently, I&apos;ve felt becoming a victim of toxic positivityincreasingly. With this post, I now want to detail the charms of thatitch.</p><h2 id="the-curse-of-positivity">The Curse of Positivity</h2><p>Interestingly, they say that to be successful on social media; Onehas to present their most authentic self. And logically, this statementthen mandates asking if human billboard Gary Vaynerchuk was indeed bornwith an authentic but highly <em>commercial</em> personality or if hisbehavior is merely a professional shtick to sell more NFTs.</p><p>Similarly, after wanting to understand if people really like LoganPaul and KSI&apos;s new &quot;PRIME&quot; soft drink, naively I youtube&apos;d &quot;primereview&quot; only to come across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk2UDs8wXKI">video</a> of &quot;No LifeShaq,&quot; a dude that &quot;got big off purely big-upping everyone.&quot; Hissurprising verdict: It tastes A M A Z I N G.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/big-upping.png"></p><p>And while I may now fall into the category of &quot;hating ass clowns,&quot; Ihave to say that I would have wished to click on a more critical reviewof the beverage.</p><p>See, I don&apos;t feel like the collective soyfacing of Tesla isnecessarily a bad thing for society, considering that it may havecontributed to awakening the Swabian automobile giants to make morefuel-efficient cars. Similarly, I believe that the CO2 criticism ofcryptocurrencies will continue to have a positive effect on thefield.</p><p>Although, I feel there&apos;s now a class of positivity, stirred up bydisjoint interest, which outcomes I&apos;d mostly describe as toxic.</p><p>But the narrative of favoring optimistic quantitative engagement onsocial media platforms is still controversially discussed way beyond mylittle website.</p><p>Most prominently, with Youtube recently removing the dislike countfrom videos to reduce bullying on the platform. Seemingly challenged tomake a rational argument, the dislike button&apos;s proponents now claim thatthey cannot differentiate good from bad tutorial videos.</p><h2 id="getting-ratioed">Getting Ratioed</h2><p>Though, what that argument misses is a conversation about getting <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ratioed">ratioed</a>and its detrimental effects on the creator&apos;s soul. And as someone thathas had <a href="https://plausible.io/timdaub.github.io?period=12mo">32.1kimpressions</a> from Hacker News while writing a column aboutcryptocurrencies and web3, I, for one, can confidently claim to be aconvincing witness of &quot;getting ratioed.&quot;</p><p>The other day, I had the stupid idea of reviving one of my mostpopular posts called &quot;web3 is a stupid idea&quot; by re-submitting it to/r/ethereum. And while the post had some genuine negativity aroundEthereum&apos;s vision of creating a web3 and not an internet2, I&apos;d arguethat the post&apos;s message ends up being a friendly riff on Ethereum&apos;smainstream vision.</p><p>Although I knew the post had previously done extraordinarily well onthe web3-critical Hacker News, I wasn&apos;t ready for Reddit&apos;s rudereaction.</p><p>Just seconds after posting, I was being called a &quot;cranky monkey&quot; just&quot;bitching about web3.&quot; While I tried to defuse the situation with humor,the broader community agreed with the premature headline reader byupvoting their rude comment.</p><p>And so, after just a few hours, and in a phase of my self-confidencediminishing, I deleted the post and arranged with myself to furtherlimit my involvement with the /r/ethereum community. Screw them.</p><h2 id="negativity-through-toxic-positivity">Negativity Through ToxicPositivity</h2><p>Now, understandably one may say that my experience had little to dowith witnessing &quot;toxic positivity&quot; as most of the above-mentionedreactions stemmed from negativity. But I&apos;d, hereon, like to argue that Ibelieve their source is excessive optimism towards the project and thatit stems from short-term monetary interest.</p><p>In the case of Reddit communities or Hacker News, this way ofbanishing members of the potential out-group allows the group&apos;s delusionto survive. &quot;<a href="https://nav.al/failure">Groups Never AdmitFailure</a>,&quot; and indeed, if we&apos;d think about groups huddling aroundexcessive negativity, then we&apos;d notice a similar effect.</p><h2 id="critical-crypto-currencies">Critical Crypto Currencies</h2><p>With the cryptocurrency market almost having morphed into a bearrecently, it has become a source of relaxation for me.</p><p>I&apos;ve found the excessive hyping and nonsense noise in the last yeardifficult to deal with. I&apos;m not mad that we&apos;ve received more attentionthan usual. But I think my spot of comfort is in a market that isn&apos;tentirely irrational and driven by boom and bust. Maybe I like me somegood old crypto winters.</p><p>Or, and that I&apos;d prefer, the crypto market and its moonbois just growup and learn to deal with critique professionally.</p><p>As a long-term believer of the space&apos;s visions, I&apos;d argue that onlyhighly critical contact with the subject matter will lead to excellentresults over the long term. So I&apos;d be happy to see less hilarity andmore humbleness.</p><hr><h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2><ul><li><a href="/#writing">All posts</a></li><li>2021-02-22: <a href="/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">Ethereum isn&apos;t funanymore</a></li><li>2021-12-15: <a href="/2021/12/15/token-holders-arent-slaying-moloch/">Are Token HoldersSlaying Moloch?</a></li><li>2020-09-08: <a href="/2020/09/08/web3/">web3 is a stupid idea(&#x1F50A;)</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Written by: <a href="https://github.com/pinkiebell">pinkiebell</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/timdaub">TimDaub</a>.</strong></p><p>Composability is a quality of EVM-based smart contract singletons toexpose an immutable and openly-accessible API. The property ofcomposability in Ethereum-based smart contracts paired with thetokenization of assets made it possible to create Decentralized Finance(short: &quot;DeFi&quot;), crypto currencies&apos; greatest driver of innovationyet.</p><p>If &quot;2022 is the year of the DAO&quot;, then all years prior were probably&quot;the years of financial composability&quot; as this unique property of smartcontracts has given rise to the most innovative monetary applicationsdevelopers have ever seen before.</p><p>But <strong>is it time to move on from Solidity-levelcomposability?</strong> Is it worth breaking it for the sake ofscalability and utility of the overall Ethereum network? Adiscussion.</p><h2 id="composability-softwares-greatest-property">Composability,software&apos;s greatest property?</h2><p>First of all, the concept of composability isn&apos;t new, and EVM-basedlanguages didn&apos;t invent it either.</p><p>We argue that most readers will likely be intimately familiar withthe last big composability paradigm shift in software engineering. Itwas all web developers agreeing on making their web APIs RESTful.</p><p>By using JSON and being mindful of the shared state on the web, wemanaged to successfully scale the web into a broadly-useful network ofservices. It&apos;s why today, most programming languages ironically includethe &quot;<strong>JavaScript</strong> Object Notation&quot; (short: &quot;JSON&quot;), aswith the adoption of the REST composability paradigm, it has become themost popular serialization format.</p><p>We, hence, define the term composability independently from EVM-basedinterfaces. We say that two distinct pieces of software are composablewhen their interfaces allow them to be used together.</p><p>Given that definition, we argue that properly semantically-versionedopen source software is &quot;composable,&quot; as are POSIX-compliant tools.</p><p>Still, Solidity smart contract composability differs as it does notonly allow programs to collaborate on managing information but money.Hence, Ethereum&apos;s composability property is innovative as it enablesgluing together various financial applications.</p><p>However, in the past month, we&apos;ve come to realize that today&apos;scomposability of EVM-based contracts more of an obstacle than abeneficiary feature to all.</p><h2 id="defi-ethereums-poster-child">DeFi, Ethereum&apos;s &quot;PosterChild&quot;</h2><p>We probably don&apos;t have to convince anyone of the greatness of DeFi.But for any crypto hodlers awaking from cryostasis, YES, Ethereum&apos;skiller application has been found, and it&apos;s DeFi.</p><p>DeFi is such a great killer application that it has started to impactthe viability of other use cases on Ethereum. It&apos;s because it has madeusing Ethereum very expensive.</p><p>See, the problem is in DeFi degen on-chain trading. Before the adventof automated market makers (short &quot;AMM&quot;), using Ethereum was fairlycheap, with transaction fees ranging from a few cents to maybe a dollaror two.</p><p>Only with the &quot;recent&quot; influx of on-chain trading has it becomewidespread and rationally accepted that any transaction goes for as longas it&apos;s profitable. If you inspect the chain today, you&apos;ll find thatsome traders in the past took on massive costs to execute trades withonly dubious profit. To draw an extreme picture, we argue that it maytechnically be rational to pay the equivalent of 999 ETH in transactioncost just to make back 999.000000000000000001 ETH (difference: 1 WEI) ofprofit in the process.</p><p>It&apos;s because traders can control Ethereum&apos;s transaction atomicity andprofitability to a fair degree until the very moment of execution. Incontrast to an intransparent order book of a centralized Wall Streetexchange, Ethereum&apos;s transaction pool is entirely inspectable by anyparticipants, allowing them to &quot;guarantee&quot; certain results.</p><p>And beyond just that, much more is possible through specifyingconditions in Solidity (and recently MEV):</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">require(profit &gt; msg.value, &quot;non profitable trade&quot;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="gas-change-is-real">Gas-change is real!</h2><p>At this point, it should hence not surprise anyone when we claim thatmarket-based pricing may not reflect the inclusion of externalcosts.</p><p>On Ethereum, the egoistic behavior or running every DeFi tradepossible as long as it&apos;s profitable comes with the external cost offorcing less viable projects to migrate to, e.g., other chains. Is thatdigital gentrification?</p><p>For sure, though, it&apos;s a real problem that has led to shiftingdynamics in the world of software development.</p><p>While it may have formerly been acceptable to put the entirety of adapp&apos;s transactions on-chain, today, it&apos;s a really bad idea.Heuristically, it has come to mean that if a decentralized applicationdoesn&apos;t provide the equivalent value of, say, DeFi provides to traders,then this non-DeFi application is likely to have a hard time competingfor viability - given its enormous gas costs.</p><p>A striking example of this may have been the abandoning of Aragon andthe simultaneous rise in popularity of snapshot.org voting. While Aragonused to put all transactions on-chain to implement a mixture of tokenvoting and multi-signature wallet, today&apos;s snapshot.org off-chains thewhole vote by default and leaves solving the multi-signature use case toothers (e.g., Gnosis Safe).</p><p>But by and large, the above-described dynamic visualizes the space&apos;sgreatest problem well: It&apos;s that if your non-financial application isn&apos;tcapable of providing similar viability to DeFi, then we&apos;re better offnot building it on Ethereum.</p><h2 id="future-state-will-be-expensive-too">Future State Will BeExpensive Too</h2><p>Those who understand the dilemma of scaling blockchains, as, e.g.,Vitalik had laid it out in one of his blog posts [1], also must realizethat state being competitively-priced isn&apos;t going to go away in thefuture.</p><p>Not to say that it may eventually get cheap when we all start owningsuper-fancy quantum computers. But until those unlikely inventionsbecome realities, we&apos;d argue that state will remain expensive. It&apos;llstay expensive on Ethereum, and the market will take care of equatingprices between peripheral chains like Polygon.</p><p>For those that don&apos;t understand or value the original concept ofstoring state on blockchains, it may continue to be cheap. After all,there&apos;s always a database or less secure chain to store it on.</p><p>But for those that value the guarantees that Ethereum and otherprojects were built upon, state will continue to be competitivelypriced.</p><h2 id="why-were-arguing-for-breaking-solidity-level-composability">WhyWe&apos;re Arguing For Breaking Solidity-level Composability</h2><p>In the end, breaking composability with Ethereum smart contracts canmean many different things in practice. Rollups and L2 contractsexemplify composability paradigms being actively broken and &quot;movedupwards.&quot; Yes, calling &quot;through to L2&quot; will one day be a possibility;but other roll-up architects may want to consider more extreme variantsto increase scalability.</p><p>We, the authors, have experimented with breaking composability forthe sake of reducing gas costs by selectively applying some principlesused in roll-ups too. While roll-ups have come to define themselves as acombination of trustless bridges and on-chain data validation, throughexperimentation, we found that breaking composability can significantlyreduce contracts&apos; gas costs by deliberately applying L2-scalingstrategies to regular L1 contracts.</p><p>In this article, we call for breaking the Solidity-levelcomposability as, e.g., adding gas-optimizations to the Soliditycompiler or using, e.g., sparse Merkle trees as alternative statestorage may indeed save significant levels of gas for the user but canlead to incompatibilities with traditional contracts that rely on thecomposable Ethereum message call interface [2].</p><p>If e.g., we&apos;d break the composability of ERC20 tokens and allow thosecontracts to batch validate transfers, we&apos;d make everyone in DeFiunhappy as we&apos;d now require everyone to submit their transactionsthrough an off-chain sequencer rather than the standard (&amp;composable) Solidity call interface.</p><p>Suddenly, calling a third-party contract&apos;s <code>transferFrom</code>would stop being straightforward. As composability was broken on theSolidity level, it&apos;d likely require us to set up a sequencing server aswell.</p><p>We want to argue that we believe that making deliberate breakingchanges to the ecosystem&apos;s architecture would benefit it over the longterm. We think the current stateful composability paradigm for L1contracts blocks scaling, and new solutions will have to bediscovered.</p><p>Distributed systems have a high computational overhead in comparisonto their centralized counterparts. Thus, using those systems only forthe minimum viable enforcement is a requirement if we want them to bethe &quot;World&apos;s Computer.&quot; As developers, we must agree and accept thaton-chain state and its validation is a scarce resource and should betreated with economic care. Posting data to the blockchain is cheap;transforming and storing it is expensive.</p><p>Hence, we propose to move the composability to another layer withoutsacrificing security to receive better scaling results.</p><p><strong>Written by: <a href="https://github.com/pinkiebell">pinkiebell</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/timdaub">TimDaub</a>.</strong></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li>1: <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html">https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html</a></li><li>2: <a href="https://github.com/rugpullindex/indexed-sparse-merkle-tree">https://github.com/rugpullindex/indexed-sparse-merkle-tree</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year started out with a new year&apos;s resolution of using even lesssocial media than in 2021. As my diet now excludes Reddit and HackerNews, for the last two days, I&apos;ve been aimlessly browsing the web insearch for interesting stuff. It&apos;s quite boring out there... Do I feelcold turkey? Am I OK???</p><p>But for some reason, this morning, I ended up checking out an articleof <a href="https://thedefiant.io/">thedefiant</a> and saw that they usea neat little site called &quot;<a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">unlockprotocol</a>&quot; as a crypto-native monetization mechanism. I immediatelygot excited as I love me a simple but honest implementation of some&quot;future tech.&quot; For the definat, the unlock protocol is a generic paywallthey put in front of their posts so that users are asked to pay beforethey can access content.</p><p>With my curiosity caught, I went on Unlock&apos;s GitHub and looked attheir code. I also stalked their employees (as you do, right?) and theirfounder. In fact, I suddenly found myself on the <a href="https://www.ouvre-boite.com/">founder&apos;s blog</a> playing with theUnlock paywall integration (the founder&apos;s blog is using it too).Actually, I was even interested in giving it a shot. The blog postssounded interesting, so I tried to become a &quot;member&quot;:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/hyperfollow.png"></p><p>Both on Desktop and Mobile, the intergration that Unlock Protocol didwith WalletConnect and Metamask is neatly done. I even had to signsomething and I was guided nicely through the process.</p><p>But then came the step that involved paying money and there I wasbasically kicked in the stomach. Paying was only possible withxDAI...</p><p><img src="/assets/images/xdaicheckout.png"></p><h2 id="the-multichain-future-is-multi-problematic">The MultichainFuture is Multi Problematic</h2><p>See, had my wallet contained xDAI then surely I would have paid forthe article, enjoyed reading it and moved on with my life. But it didn&apos;tand so now I&apos;m upset for missing out on the article but also because I&apos;mrealizing that the problem is far bigger than Unlock Protocol&apos;s unluckycheckout page.</p><p>It&apos;s that the ecosystem has falsely promoted the &quot;multichain is thefuture&quot; narrative, without properly thinking about its consequences.</p><p>A quick intermittened definition of what I mean by &quot;multichain&quot; isthat instead of picking and transaction on one chain to rule them all(e.g. Ethereum or Bitcoin), a multichain application would featuresupport for many different chains (e.g. Ethereum and Bitcoin andPolkadot and Tezos).</p><p>I almost feel reactionary to say this right now, but multichain isreally problematic. And that isn&apos;t news.</p><p>Already in 2017 and before, some crypto currency enthusiasts went onstages publicly and proclaimed a &quot;multicoin future&quot; and that later on,it won&apos;t really matter what coins we&apos;re transacting with. The samepeople later proclaimed that DAI and USDC are to the USD what fileformats like .jpg and .png are to images.</p><p>Clearly, and also undeniably, there&apos;s not only qualitative changes to.png, .jgp or DAI and USDC - promoting such a reductionistic view pointis simply harmful for everyone wanting to work by applying reason. Forsure, there&apos;s something uniquely good about arguing forinteroperability; but I remain skeptical about the motivation&apos;s of thosethat call for it.</p><p>A call for a multichain future or a call for interoperability isoften just a competitor&apos;s call for taking over market share throughmoral highground.</p><h2 id="multichain-has-a-terrible-user-experience">Multichain Has ATerrible User Experience</h2><p>But that aside, multichain simply has dreadful user experience. Hadthe Unlock founder asked me to pay Ether, a widly distributed asset,then far more users would be capable of also buying. However, since I&apos;masked to pay xDAI, I&apos;m implicitly also asked to bridge some amount ofDAI (which I may not own either) onto the xDAI chain. That&apos;s where the&quot;Multichain is the future&quot; vision falls apart for me, because it&apos;s justa nightmare.</p><p>I just want to consume a simple blog post and I&apos;m not at allinterested in bridging assets to a myriad number of other networks. Howmuch DAI should I buy? What&apos;ll be the transaction costs? How do I bridgesafely to the xDAI network? Hell, maybe I&apos;ve never heard of xDAIbefore?</p><p>Having money on multiple networks for investing already, honestly, itjust leaves me anxious and frankly I&apos;ve started losing oversight. A fewSatoshis there, a couple of Weis on ETC... Or was it ETH?</p><p>Also: I don&apos;t feel comfortable with bridging either. Last time Ichecked, bridges are often semi-decentralized and therefore sem-safe. Idon&apos;t want to pay the risk of bridging, I don&apos;t want to risk my fundsduring bridging and I&apos;d appreciate paying as little transaction costs aspossible.</p><p>So for me, not having a balance on xDAI, would it be more expensiveto send Ether on Ethereum&apos;s L1 or bridging to xDAI? Clearly, sendingEther on L1 would be cheaper. I&apos;d pay more than $5 for the membership inL1 transaction fees; but onboarding to xDAI I&apos;d have to pay thattoo.</p><p>Now, of course, you could argue that &quot;hey Tim, but once you&apos;vebridged to xDAI your transaction&apos;s are cheap&quot;. But, I&apos;d like to rejectthat argument as there&apos;d only be little probability for your nexton-chain action to be xDAI related. It&apos;s because the multichain paradigmdoesn&apos;t consider factoring in a user&apos;s chain choice.</p><h2 id="multichain-makes-developer-experience-dreadful-too">MultichainMakes Developer Experience Dreadful too</h2><p>From the perspective of a developer, the experience is equallybleak.</p><p>Unless you&apos;ve ICO&apos;ed a sick token the other year and, hence, have ashit ton of shitcoins to pay for coders, really the &quot;Multichain future&quot;is entirely unobtainable.</p><p>Isn&apos;t it hard enough to ship something of quality to a single chainalready? Who has time to support five other full nodes, watch threeother event endpoints and write code that works for six differentnetworks but always slightly differently?</p><p>Multichain is or will be dreaded by every developer. But evenbusiness types will eventually start disliking it once they&apos;ve run thenumbers that the multichain vision also means fragmenting theircommunity. Multichain means less money for more code. I just don&apos;t wannado it.</p><h2 id="why-multichain-then">Why Multichain then?</h2><p>People love the Multichain idea because it allows them to dream ofuse cases that&apos;d only be possible if we were further into the cryptocurrency future. xDAI, Polygon and BSC offer developers features thatare simply unobtainable on secure and decentralied chains likeEthereum&apos;s L1 today. Many are sick of gas fees, they hate not being ableto build their product given high storage costs.</p><p>We want what we can&apos;t have. We want super fast and cheaptransactions. The future of Unlock Protocol would be so bright if onlyall blockchain transactions would finalize so fast as on xDAI. Why can&apos;teverybody bridge their DAI onto it then? Why are we still stuck withEthereum transactions costing hundreds of dollars?</p><p>But, the proponents of the multichain paradigm purposefully ignorethat scaling blockchain to unsustainable limits <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html">isn&apos;treal</a>. Decentralized blockchains can&apos;t scale as Polygon does today.They may never scale that well!</p><p>And even today, its become incredible costly and hard to run and keepa BSC node online. Some even say, running a BSC node is &quot;<a href="https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553">a lostcause</a>&quot;.</p><p>Additionally, many side chains contain immature and centrally managedcode. Polygon, BSC and others offer dramatically different securityguarantees as e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p><p>Such dramatic guarantees that just recently, a bug that that put <a href="https://medium.com/immunefi/polygon-lack-of-balance-check-bugfix-postmortem-2-2m-bounty-64ec66c24c7d">~9,276,584,332MATIC</a> (or $20,594,017,217!) at risk, was fixed over-night through <a href="https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/commit/488ea2bcb4d9771e05b1fad12d8b86562558aab5">overwritingPolygon&apos;s bridge bytecode</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, the multichain paradigm has caught on as the bignetwork&apos;s puniness started showing in last year&apos;s hype cycle. But unlesswe want to reintroduce databases for managing money transfers, I thinkit&apos;s time to accept that insecure side chains and the multichainparadigm aren&apos;t a quick fix to some of the space&apos;s trickiestproblems.</p><p>The rule is simple: If a dapp doesn&apos;t provide equal or more value toa user than the current transaction cost on a strongly decentralizedchain, then it&apos;s probably not worth building.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a huge epiphany moment when in early 2018, <a href="https://github.com/ameensol">Ameen Soleimani</a> et al. launched&quot;<a href="https://www.molochdao.com/">MolochDAO</a>,&quot; an organizationfounded on the idea that systemically flawed processes originate fromgame theoretical failures. It was nice that the summarized the idea asthe gestalt of &quot;Moloch&quot;: The god of coordination failure, that by theway, loves children being sacrificed. But that just on the side. Here&apos;sa picture of a Moloch statue.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/moloch.jpg" alt="&quot;Wow, imagine you built this statue and showed it to your friends. That&apos;d be hellacringe.&quot;"><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>&quot;Wow, imagine you built this statueand showed it to your friends. That&apos;d be hellacringe.&quot;</em></figcaption></figure><p>The start was a blog post by infamous blogger <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Slate Star Codex</a> titled &quot;<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">MeditationsOn Moloch</a>,&quot; which I consider a must-read in neo-actuary onlineliterature for crypto-minded moonbois. But for real: &quot;Meditations onMoloch&quot; is indeed a mindblowing post, particularly when you&apos;ve neverbeen exposed to such ideas.</p><p>It&apos;d be foolish for me to summarize or indicate any other greaterunderstanding of its ideas, but I want to reiterate the broadercontext:</p><p>Scott Alexander, the author of the Slate Star Codex, is known to be arationalist thinker and in their post they make an argument for why somegames inevitably lead to coordination failure.</p><p>A classic example of such failure can be observed, e.g., thePrisoner&apos;s Dilemma. At least, if we were capable of spectating in &quot;godview&quot; upon the situation. I&apos;m not gonna re-iterate the prisoner&apos;sdilemma either: But I can say that for a god it&apos;s fairly obvious torecommend bilateral cooperation as this results in both prisoners beingfreed. The dilemma stemming from both prisoners having severely limitedcapability of collective rational decision making. Here&apos;s a flow chartof the participants&apos; choices.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/prisoners.png"></p><p>And while the game is deliberately framed to provoke the dilemma, itis a rather practical problem in today&apos;s world. It&apos;s particularly usefulto understand as it highlights other practical concepts we&apos;re currentlynot able to solve, e.g. the tragedy of the commons.</p><p>It&apos;s because when our decision impacts another number of individuals,then decision-making through individual rationality may not have thesame outcomes as through collective rationality.</p><p>You can intuitively comprehend this as you too have once been part ofsuch a failure. E.g. when during a presentation you were forced to standup as others in front of you did so earlier too. Clearly, it&apos;d makesense for everyone to just remain seated - until of course a singleperson makes the choice of standing for them and all others in theback.</p><p>And the avid reader of this blog might now also recognize this typeof topic: I&apos;ve written about similar rationalistic decision-makingfailure before when I claimed that &quot;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">On-chain,The Emperor Wears No Clothes</a>.&quot;</p><p>However, to stay on point hence, when Scott Alexander calls Molochthe god of coordination failure, they&apos;re deliberately invoking the devilhimself as a scapegoat of collective suffering.</p><p>But I wouldn&apos;t be writing this post today if it wasn&apos;t forrethorically longing for the message I&apos;ve put in the headline. That&quot;token holders aren&apos;t slaying Moloch.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s because, years ago, the cryptosphere discovered the Moloch-logicas an existential motive of their own and a reassurance of their workbeing honerable. And it is indeed honerable at face-value solving thegreat coordination problems of our times. Somehow that work must yieldpositive outcomes.</p><p>However, through working in the space long-enough, I&apos;ve come towitness that sadly, the Moloch-idea has been wrongly co-opted by thespace to further the number-go-up ideal. Or, at least some projectsexhibit this type of quality.</p><p>I&apos;m not talking about the actual MolochDAO design itself and neitherabout Ameen&apos;s work. But I&apos;ve come to see the term &quot;slaying moloch&quot; beingused by people that say one thing but do another. Maybe not for thewrong intentions; but surely while being on the wrong path.</p><p>Actually, I&apos;m happy to double down on my previous claims stating thatcollectivizing and finanicalizing decision-making isn&apos;t a sufficientsolution to slaying Moloch. &quot;Being rich or right&quot; isn&apos;t &quot;slayingMoloch&quot;. Launching yet another token isn&apos;t either.</p><p>Clearly, as we&apos;ve understood with <a href="https://youtu.be/ws06adOKNUk?t=32">Francis Haugen talking</a>,financial collectivism cannot be the solution to a game theory problemlike the tragedy of the commons. It&apos;s because despite Facebook knowingof the evil it does to people around the world by failing to properlycontent-moderate in many languages, it still does those things, forprofit.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws06adOKNUk" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><em>Video language is in english from 32 seconds on-ward...</em></p><p>Here, there&apos;s the same coordinatiorial problem as within games likethe tragedy of the commons or the prisoner&apos;s dilemma. Technicallyeverybody could start participating in Facebook by buying stock andstart profiting from all its awesome vision of &quot;connecting people&quot;. Butit&apos;d also mean being complicit with a company that has been involved ingenocide but doesn&apos;t really care. Besides, joining financialcollectivism doesn&apos;t automatically give you reasonable decision-makingpower.</p><p>Clearly, there&apos;s still a great misalignment between Facebook, thepeople of Myanmar, and its stakeholders. Likewise, in the case of the2016 US election, there was a giant misalignment between some states,Cambridge Analytica, the candidates, and everyone that believes in theUS constitution.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that going from individual rational decision-making tocollective decision-making is useless: What I&apos;m saying is that using thesame old capitalistic tricks is just leading to skeuomorphistic digitalcapitalism 2.0. Would DeFi-facebook really be better than today&apos;sTradFi-facebook? Or is all of that just &quot;same same, but different?&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;d claim that truly &quot;slaying moloch&quot; is probably far more difficultand requires much more original thinking than just introducing adigitalized version of collectivist decision-making tool.</p><p>But then additionally, as I&apos;ve outlined in &quot;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">On-chain,the Emperor Wears No Clothes</a>&quot;, rationality cannot only come incollective and individual form: It can also be driven by deontic andepistemic ideals.</p><p>So really, collective rationality disguised through epistemic idealscan be a trojan horse containing nothing but egoism. Yes, a stakeholdermay say things that sound like everyone profits, when in reality they&apos;rejust <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O9FFrLpinQ">a bandit oroutright stupid</a>. It&apos;s hard to tell but probably not harmingMoloch.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3O9FFrLpinQ" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>]]></content>

    <title>Two Years of Blogging; A Reflection</title>

    <published>2021-12-10T14:49:36.000Z</published>
    <updated>2021-12-10T14:49:36.000Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&apos;s now two years since the first time I published on this website.So it&apos;s roughly 24 months. I just counted; I managed to release 28 blogposts until today. Actually, it&apos;s an impressive number. I&apos;m surprisedit&apos;s 28, and I would have maybe guessed it&apos;s 15.</p><p>The front page now looks kind of how I like it. It&apos;s bursting withoriginality, and it&apos;s slightly intimidating. I&apos;m happy about theinformation section on the top, enumerating all my social information,like my GitHub account and related handles. But it&apos;s kinda difficult tounderstand the depth of the &quot;Writing&quot; section, though. There&apos;s a lot totake in.</p><p>I dislike that the blog has no name and that I&apos;m still hosting it on&quot;....github.io&quot;. That&apos;s against my principles, as I want to own mynamespace. But I don&apos;t feel like fighting it either. The &quot;.github.io&quot;handle is also kinda nice because it symbolizes that this is a technicalblog.</p><p>I&apos;ve started disliking the blog&apos;s theme recently. Specifically, howit looks on mobile devices. I just find it odd that on the root page,the navigation is on top, while it is on the bottom when reading anarticle. I really don&apos;t need this &quot;Share&quot; dialogue, and I doubt that myreaders naturally understand what &quot;TOC&quot; means (it stands for &quot;Table OfContent&quot;).</p><p>When visiting an article on mobile, an additional problem is thatit&apos;s unclear what website they&apos;re on. In &quot;reading mode&quot;, my blog has noheader indicating that it also hosts other content. There&apos;s noaffordance telling the user that &quot;this is a blog.&quot; They probably expectto find information on the top, but there&apos;s none.</p><p>I like the /projects page, and I try to update it regularly. I thinkit&apos;s been doing wonders for my external technical credibility. As theweb has become a space of beguilers, I notice the importance of havingan online CV that confirms my technical capabilities.</p><p>About the visitor numbers on plausible.io, I&apos;m happing with therecent uptick in SEO-related traffic. Actually, I&apos;ve been obsessing overit recently. I want to prove to myself that I am a writer whose wordscan impact the world. It&apos;s hard even to prove it to myself: But I&apos;vecome to believe that there&apos;s more than just clicks and retentionnumbers. I like to think that, sometimes, when I publish, I actuallychange or inform people&apos;s decisions. I imagine that people who runcrypto startups read my posts and become influenced.</p><p>But it&apos;s so hard to name just a minor impact with certainty. I mean,I know that my posts are having an impact as most of my freelanceclients in the last two years have originated directly from thiswebsite. I know that I&apos;m having the attention of some influential peoplein the crypto space. But I could never say so, as there isn&apos;t anyconnecting proof or public displayable clue.</p><p>I&apos;m happy to see my email subscriber list on substack.com grow, andI&apos;m glad about having reached 60 Discord members on my Rug Pull Indexserver, but I&apos;m craving for more. I think what I want is to have thefreedom of exploring my intellectual curiosity by being more financiallyfree.</p><p>I like working for the projects I have right now, but I often feellike being capable of solving much harder problems. I often ponderbefore descending into rabbit holes; it&apos;s because of the anxiety of notworking on &quot;paid problems.&quot; It&apos;s probably irrational; but I&apos;m fearing toharm my financial status and career by tackling too complex technicalproblems.</p><p>With my blog here on timdaub.github.io, I&apos;ve started seeing myself assomewhat of a tech columnist, and I&apos;ve also wondered what exactly it iswhat I&apos;m doing. By no means do I have any reasonable understanding ofjournalism, and probably it&apos;s one of those occupations I would havenever thought to touch with my work. But I&apos;m now frequently askingmyself if what I&apos;m doing isn&apos;t a form of journalism, really. If words,sentences, language and terminology are such exciting concepts, do Ieven want to have a monolithic career in building software?</p><p>Prompted by my blogging success, I started journaling my thoughtsoffline too. And recently, I&apos;ve come to better understand the meaningbehind &quot;journaling.&quot;</p><p>Today, through this structured effort expressing my thoughts on thelatest developments in the cryptosphere, I almost understand it as acraft or art. I still spend a lot of time on plausible.io, checking mypost&apos;s stats. But I&apos;m also mindfully emphasizing the idea that if Iwrite something I personally find meaningfully, that then others willcome to appreciate that too.</p><p>I&apos;ve had phases where all that counted was clicks: That&apos;s how &quot;web3is a stupid idea&quot; and &quot;Ethereum isn&apos;t fun anymore&quot; were written. Butreading those pieces now, I&apos;m not too impressed by their assertions andrhetoric.</p><p>I love how well I optimized those posts for doing well on socialplatforms. Still, I am truly proud of posts that challenged meintellectually when I wrote them.</p><p>For example, I&apos;m happy to be the second person to write about&quot;Sleepminting.&quot; I&apos;m proud of myself for discovering the connection ofdeontic and epistemic authority in financial and technical stakeholders(&quot;On-chain, The Emperor Wears No Clothes&quot;). And I feel accomplishedthinking that I may have coined the concepts of &quot;Technical Yield&quot; andpurposefully &quot;Blowing up Scope.&quot;</p><p>Blogging has enriched my professional life, and although I sometimeshave doubts about its purpose, I don&apos;t want to miss having my bloganymore. It&apos;s become almost like an investment in myself and I&apos;vemanaged to cash out on some of its benefits. That&apos;s great and so for2022 and beyond, I hope to grow and get better acquainted with myaudience too. This blog may grow.</p><p>Uniquely, writing is my second favorite creative process I&apos;ve learnedto enjoy besides coding. In fact, some days it&apos;s my favorite. So aboveall, being able to express me and my ideas through language, it beingcode, English, or German - I&apos;ve come to realize as my biggest privilege.I love working with language, and so in the future, I&apos;d be grateful tohave the chance to expand my knowledge on this topic further.</p><p>To all my companions, I&apos;m grateful to enjoy your company!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(Originially posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/r9d9gf/illuminating_the_dark_forest/">/r/ethereum</a>)</em></p><p>We&apos;ve now been in the bull market for so long that I believe thereference frame for what many of us initially came to crypto for isstarting to be forgotten.</p><p>Today, besides angry gas fee posts, what really seems to be poppingis borderline-legal DAO meme projects that promise wildly seductive APYnumbers (&quot;7000% APY&quot;), while the reality is that many of those projectsare outright illegal and immoral Ponzi schemes with great web designthough.</p><p>Seeing all those huge green numbers on a daily basis, it&apos;s easy tosometimes forget why we joined the space in the first place: to buildbetter organizations and to update the internet!</p><p>As a case in point, OlympusDAO:</p><p>By visiting its website, it&apos;s almost hard to believe: but a projectlike the much-hyped OlympusDAO registered their domain just months ago,on 2021-03-27, and so I find it kind of difficult to understand if theproject and its members have the required long-term commitment to makemeaningful contributions to the space [5]. Especially because innovatingin the space has historically only worked through grinding the bleedingedge for multiple years at a time. I don&apos;t doubt the integrity of theOlympusDAO&apos;s founders. But that&apos;s because I simply don&apos;t know them!</p><p>How do I know that meaningful contribution only comes throughlong-term commitment? I&apos;ve been a founding member of ascribe.io and theOcean Protocol, and they&apos;ve been shipping for 6 years straight now toget to where they&apos;re today: on CMC #130 [2]! The classic ten years to anovernight success story.</p><p>But more simply put, the point I&apos;m trying to make here is that theprovenance mechanism we&apos;re so proud of in the NFT space has started tobecome broken in the web3 startup space!</p><p>Even for a seasoned developer, it&apos;s become harder and harder tounderstand what are good projects and who are those that are just in forthe quick money or pulling the rug [3, 9].</p><p>The provenance of crypto startups has become unclear as, givenregulatory pressure, many startup founders have chosen to launchanonymously. It&apos;s cool because it means that many traditionallydiscriminated people can now launch a project without facing unnecessaryscrutiny or glass ceilings. It&apos;s bad because we have no reference pointanymore for who&apos;s done good in the past and who&apos;s done bad. Today, howcan we know? And as users, how can we protect ourselves and ourinvestments?</p><p>At the same time, the security incidents plaguing smart contractshave become frequent pop-cultural events; We don&apos;t even take themseriously anymore. They&apos;ve become entertainment as rekt.news existenceproves [4]. It&apos;s as if we can&apos;t wait to hear about the latest hackeddevelopers and the background story: But cloaked behind these seeminglyunspectacular security incidents hides a much bigger crisis! It&apos;s thatweb3 has become a DARK and DANGEROUS place! In 2020, D. Robinson and G.Konstantopoulos write: &quot;Ethereum is a dark forest.&quot; [1].</p><p>In the authors&apos; own words, Ethereum&apos;s story has become &quot;a horrorstory.&quot; It is about a dystopian, adversarial, and unlawful place whereeveryone just banks on the weakness of their peers for their personalprofit. &quot;An environment in which detection means certain death at thehands of advanced predators&quot; [1].</p><p>Through those eyes that seem to see today&apos;s reality more clearly thanour naive web2 goggles, all web3 products ought to be at first observedwith caution. What are the true motivations that guide some DAO&apos;smasterminds? Are they here to change the world for the better? Or arethey merely attempting an elaborate coup for their personalenrichment?</p><p>The problem in today&apos;s space is that WE CANNOT KNOW! Theinfrastructure for documenting and fighting scams simply isn&apos;t there.We&apos;re not capable of resolving disputes, but even worse: We&apos;re not evenproperly documenting what&apos;s happening. My biggest fear is that if thecrypto space continues to fail to regulate itself: Inherently, we&apos;llhave to be regulated ... by you know whom!</p><p>The most we do t0day, is that we reside to document scams on, e.g.,Reddit through &quot;lists of rug pulls&quot; [6]. I guess we&apos;re also trying towarn our peers in DMs, and for particularly bad cases, we sometimesspeak up publicly.</p><p>But most attacks on all our hard-earned money aren&apos;t &quot;security&quot;incidents as it is, e.g., framed by rekt.news.</p><p>Sure, these events are disguised as broken contracts and flawedimplementations: But the reality is that all those hackers causing themended up taking the calculated risk of stealing money from users as coinmixing allows them to anonymously exit their profits, e.g., throughtornado.cash [7].</p><p>So while it looks as though the situation is under control throughever-improving static analysis tools and more frequent security audits,the problem isn&apos;t directly about building flawless smart contracts butmuch more about the integrity of project founders! The web3 communityhas a safety crisis and flawed smart contract security is merely a sideeffect.</p><p>It&apos;s because the web3 space that prouds itself with its friendlinesstowards anonymous project founders has created a system so immune toproper provenance that it stops becoming humanly possible to do properdue diligence before committing funds. Even as a long-term member of thespace, it&apos;s become tough knowing the wheat from the chaff!</p><p>A path out of the dark forest, or at least towards finding a guidinglight that could illuminate it, lies, in my opinion, in improving thecurrent provenance system through algorithmically-aided positivereinforcement and better documentation. We need to strengthen ourcapacity to do due diligence collectively.</p><p>To learn from our mistakes and the space&apos;s most flawed projects, Ithink it is up to all of us to make a change!</p><p>We have to start documenting shady behavior not only when it&apos;s toolate. We should hold adversarial founders accountable not only afterthey&apos;ve committed immoral action - but throughout their entire rise tofame.</p><p>Finally, we&apos;re now in a time where data can truly be available forextended periods of time and where we&apos;re capable of easily verifying itsintegrity. It&apos;s a chance for us to build better infrastructure fordocumenting what is happening, annotating documents, and exposingtroublesome information.</p><p>Using on-chain data, we can now rate a project&apos;s health in real-timeand potentially provide relative safety scores. Dispute resolutionprotocols like Kleros and others may potentially even allow us toresolve confliects within web3 - without ever having to surface into theworld of atoms [8].</p><p>We have the tools to illuminate the dark forest and make it a safeplace for everyone. But it&apos;s on us to work in making that change happen!To illuminate the dark forest.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol type="1"><li><a href="https://medium.com/@danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff">https://medium.com/(at)danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff/</a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ocean-protocol/">https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ocean-protocol/</a></li><li><a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/11/30/original-observations-about-todays-crypto-bull-market/">https://timdaub.github.io/2021/11/30/original-observations-about-todays-crypto-bull-market/</a></li><li><a href="https://rekt.news/">https://rekt.news/</a></li><li><a href="https://who.is/whois/olympusdao.finance">https://who.is/whois/olympusdao.finance</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pztg86/an_extensive_list_of_rug_pulls_committed_by/">https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pztg86/an_extensive_list_of_rug_pulls_committed_by/</a></li><li><a href="https://tornado.cash/">https://tornado.cash/</a></li><li><a href="https://kleros.io/">https://kleros.io/</a></li><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/rug-pull">https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/rug-pull</a></li></ol>]]></content>

And while by no means, I consider myself a crypto bull - thesolvency of against-the-market bettors surely is uncertain rightnow.</p><p>Rationality has rage quit the game, and so here we are. But actually,I wanna keep this short and focused. I just want to journal theobservations of these days&apos; market sentiment for posterity.</p><p>The following are original observations of the cryptosphere in thetoday&apos;s &quot;late-stage&quot; bull market. They&apos;re original, as theysignificantly differ from the observations I made in, e.g., the lastlate-stage bull market in crypto in 2018. By no means is this listexhaustive:</p><ul><li>The bull market has lasted so long that certain bullshit qualitiesand behavior now managed to persist into the sphere&apos;s &quot;culture&quot; withoutmarket participants being aware. Whole projects are founded on hot airbut faithful in their belief that the hype train will eventually come topick them up.</li><li>External spectators, e.g., commentators of Hacker News, have stoppedbeing capable of differentiating between the space&apos;s former qualityprojects and today&apos;s bullshit. They (rightfully?) equate all of cryptoto a big scam or ponzi, and their tone has turned particularlyaggressive and unforgiving.</li><li>Genuine present-day innovation is being undervalued compared tospeculative future results. I have colleagues complain that all theircommunity wants is tokens when, in fact, they&apos;re shipping game-changinginnovation.</li><li>Some of the space&apos;s newcomers that I meet are so deluded andconfused that any non-hype-based narrative slips past them. Will therebe a lost generation of crypto devs?</li><li>Generally, any non-hype-based and crypto-mainstream-leaning ideagets left unnoticed while repeating the 0815-formula gets particularwide-ranging praise. Does your project even exist without launching anERC20 token?</li><li>A degree of thought-synchronization has taken place thatdiscriminates originality and evangelizes <em>the one way of doingthings.</em></li><li>Numerous long-standing contributors that I have known to be truebelievers over many years have started turning sour and cynical. Somehave become openly and/or cloaked opponents/critics.</li><li>For everyone, including experts in the field, it continues to becomemore challenging to separate noise from signal.</li><li>It has become ludicrously easy to raise money with no stringsattached to build any type of software. It&apos;s great, but it doesn&apos;t feelreal.</li></ul><p>And that&apos;s all. I hope you can appreciate this different type ofblogging too.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the many months of an uninterrupted bull market, I think I canspeak for all of us and say: &quot;We&apos;re exhausted!&quot;</p><p>During the bull, everything looks like an opportunity and winners arebubbling up at an accelerated pace. Noise is high and so to stand out,everyone does whatever it takes to cut through the bullshit.</p><p>After all, every chain could be the next Ethereum. Every project, thenext Uniswap and every founder, the next Jeffrey, JEFFREY BEZOOOS.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ignONliwBQ" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>But, really, how urgently do we have to ship? How important is it tohave success now versus having it later? Does the crypto super bull holdthe chance of our lifetime? Or is any time a good time to startsomething new?</p><h2 id="the-value-of-fomo">The Value of FOMO</h2><p>FOMO, or the &quot;fear of missing out,&quot; is a prevalentlymillennial-produced emotion that describes the anxiety arising ininternet users when spectating on their fun-having f(r)iends throughsocial apps like Instagram, Facebook and others.</p><p>Y&apos;all know it. It starts by excusing yourself on the group chat for&quot;having no time to join,&quot; only to later realize that you must havemissed out ON THE SOCIAL HAPPENING OF THE MONTH when checking theirawesome pictures, snaps and stories.</p><p>It seems that in 2021, we should know better, though. I&apos;ve describedthe underlying phenomenon in another one of my posts and titled it <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/07/21/nfts-are-coming-for-instagram/">&quot;NFTsare coming for Instagram and other social media platforms&quot;</a>.</p><p>The post tells the story of how we distort our realities with socialmedia usage and that our yacht-boarding idols; Maybe they&apos;re not soglamorous after all. Maybe, besides their many followers, all they trulyhave is the knowledge of how to look amazing online.</p><p>And so, I think acknowledging this type of contemporary socialflexing, we should manage to identify FOMO-induced urgency during thecrypto bull market too.</p><h2 id="urgency-is-fomo-and-fomo-isnt-a-good-decision-making-criteria.">Urgencyis FOMO; And FOMO isn&apos;t a good decision-making criteria.</h2><p>Yes, really, urgency is a more defined version of anxiety or <em>fearof missing out</em>. It promotes the infamous &apos;ape-ing&apos;. It&apos;s thenatural signal of our body telling us that our lives are threatenedbecause we&apos;re about to miss out. Our brains scream: &quot;Hey! LOOK THERE!Others are feasting on some delicious berries or whatever! GET IN THERENOOOOW!&quot;</p><p>And so, the natural reaction is to do exactly that. FOMO, it&apos;s thereason we had no toilet paper in the beginning of 2020. It&apos;s sadly alsoof existential matter to the functioning of the crypto bull market.</p><p>Personally, I&apos;ve learned in my career, though, that acting onemotions isn&apos;t always a good choice to make quality decisions. Indeed, Inoticed that the less irrational and the more grounded in reality I madepast decisions, the higher quality they ended up being over the longrun.</p><h2 id="first-mover-advantage">&quot;First-mover advantage&quot;</h2><p>In venture capital, they&apos;ve even managed to name the concept. Ifyou&apos;re into their type of talk, you might know that sometimes they talkabout &quot;First- and last-mover advantages.&quot;</p><p>Their stories? That Facebook and Google only became successful forbuilding the respective &quot;last&quot; search engine and social network.</p><p>Legend has it that Larry and Sergey discovered their edge in themarket by being &quot;late to the party&quot; and fixing search engines&apos;low-quality results by improving &quot;10x&quot; upon the problem by inventingPageRank.</p><p>Sure, Yahoo and AlterVista were also interested in high-qualityresults. But by being so much better, Google simply made themirrelevant.</p><h2 id="cryptos-first-movers">Crypto&apos;s First Movers</h2><p>As a long-time lurker, I think similar things have already happenedin the cryptosphere too. Case in point: Those popular in crypto weren&apos;tits first movers.</p><p>Actually, many of the space&apos;s former figureheads, its &quot;first-movers,&quot;have failed to retain relative relevancy, in my opinion. It&apos;d be a bitmean to name some here, but I invite you to trust my argument.</p><p>Those that are at the space&apos;s top today aren&apos;t those that wereimpactful back then. Indeed, today&apos;s crypto celebs seem to have emergedonly recently. And that makes sense, too, given that DeFi, for example,is a very emergent sub field.</p><p>Back in 2016 and earlier, my impression today is that crypto wasrather governed by &quot;weirdos&quot; living on tight spectrums. Funnily enough,some of the sphere&apos;s most (in)famous are now dead, in jail or have movedon entirely. I&apos;ve written about that idea before too, it&apos;s what I triedto say with <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">&quot;Ethereumisn&apos;t fun anymore.&quot;</a></p><h2 id="about-the-urgency-of-building-web3">About the Urgency ofbuilding Web3</h2><p>So then, is it necessary to act on our urgency when building web3? Isit worth prioritizing shipping above anything else? Personal well-being?Quality? Values?</p><p>I&apos;d say no.</p><p>In my opinion, the hearts and minds of any industry are won bydeliberate long-term commitment and continuous meaningfulcontributions.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t success come down to trust built between people? And doesn&apos;tthat take lots of time?</p><p>I believe so, and that&apos;s why I want to reject the notion of urgency.I want to reject the idea that today is a more unique time to startsomething new than any other day. I want to believe that today is asgood of a time to start something new as any other day.</p><p>And that&apos;s why I think there&apos;s no urgency in building web3.WAGMI.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The Metaverse,&quot; everybody&apos;s new favorite tech vision after &quot;theSingularity,&quot; has recently had its inflection moment when Zuck decidedto rename his shitty website from Facebook to &quot;Meta&quot;.</p><p>First of all, thanks, Mark, for ruining another word - but secondly:Can we stop talking about it? <a href="https://outline.com/DUdr8Y">TheMetaverse is bullshit, it&apos;s called the internet</a>. Also, <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/the-metaverse-is-already-here-its-minecraft-99c89ed8ba2">it&apos;salready here and called &quot;Minecraft.&quot;</a></p><p>And while I think that we should anyways move on from the term&quot;Metaverse&quot; to something more positively co-notated (no, I haven&apos;t readSnowcrash) and original; to help further the rationale that &quot;theMetaverse is bullshit&quot; - I&apos;d like to highlight another aspect of thatstory today: I think a corporation like Facebook isn&apos;t able to create aparallel universe anyway.</p><p>See, I think that Zuck et al. already done goofed when theyconfidently proclaimed to be the Metaverse&apos;s creators in their recentkeynote announcement. What it shows is that they have a false sense ofconfidence about knowing what people want and their capabilities.</p><p>Can Facebook create a parallel universe everyone is comfortable in?Is the Metaverse&apos;s scope not too big for a single company to create?</p><p>As a software developer, I stare at screens for many hours of my day.And I&apos;ve come to realize that actively limiting my on-screen time isgood. I&apos;ve concluded that staring at screens isn&apos;t serving me too wellover a longer period of time.</p><p>It has to do with lots of physical constraints - namely, that my bodyslowly adjusts to sitting in a chair all day and all that jazz. Forexample, I get back and shoulder pain. But also: What happens on myscreens contributes to my mental health status too.</p><p>When I feel constrained, belittled, or misunderstood by the computer;I get angry, anxious and generally, my mood worsens.</p><p>I&apos;ve come to realize that those emotions are evoked particularly atcertain times and only with certain software. Sure, having the agency toperceive the world as I want, I&apos;ve still come to appreciate theprinciples of pioneers like the Free Software Foundation. I quote fromthe <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">gnu website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Free software means users have the four essential freedoms: (0) torun the program, (1) to study and change the program in source codeform, (2) to redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modifiedversions.</p></blockquote><p>People, dogmatic about the principles of the FSF are often belittledin the software development community. Like, for example, recently, whenon a panel asked about open-sourcing the Teslabot&apos;s software, Elon Musksnarkily remarked that (I&apos;m paraphrasing): &quot;Yeah, but we can&apos;t make itopen-source as people should pay for it [the Teslabot].&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s the classical dilemma. Either you are open-source, or you&apos;remaking stacks of cash.</p><p>But what&apos;s also important to highlight is that I think generallyspeaking, a user&apos;s happiness is so much higher when they can afford touse a well-maintained program that is &quot;free as in libre.&quot;</p><p>The freedom of expression that a piece of open-source software givesme over a SaaS or a tightly-controlled binary is so much greater. I canfile bug reports, I can influence the program&apos;s roadmap - I can evenimplement features.</p><p>There&apos;s no limit to the customizability of the program. I can make itdo what I want. I can inspect it. But most importantly, if I want to, Ican be in control.</p><p>For free software, mostly, there&apos;s no gatekeeping about the futureeither: &quot;Everything goes&quot; as long as contributors agree on &quot;how thingsare done.&quot; And the question of &quot;what to do?&quot; is often subject tospontaneous and rough consensus between contributors.</p><p>On the other hand, commerical or proprietary software always follows<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">deonticideals</a>. Its existence is informed by the motive to extract rent.Here, we code because we need to make a living. That isn&apos;treprehensible; but logically, as rent extraction is the sole purpose forexistence and future perspective; a proprietary software&apos;s developmentconcentrates on the conservation of that attribute.</p><p>So a process as Facebook has it, geared towards generatingproprietary software, I believe, cannot achieve creating anall-encompassing parallel and digital universe because it simply won&apos;tachieve reflection of all users&apos; desires. Simply put, it won&apos;t be ableto create the <em>actual</em> Metaverse as its corporate communicationstructure won&apos;t be capable of do so. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&apos;s law</a>,everybody.</p><p>Probably, with the help of the likes of McKinsey &amp; Company,Facebook will be able to create something that people want: Butlong-term, that won&apos;t be what we&apos;re longing for.</p><p>What we&apos;re longing for can only be created through a principled,democratic, free and open approach many sometimes call &quot;chaotic.&quot; Thefree software and open source community.</p><p>In a way, the Metaverse is long here, and we&apos;ve all been consumed byit. It&apos;s everything that we do on our computers already. It&apos;s theinternet, it&apos;s programs, it&apos;s Minecraft and it&apos;s the memes and storieswe tell each other.</p><p>Sorry Zuck, we don&apos;t need you for that.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2017 I boarded a special plane. My second flight to New York Citywith Lufthansa from Berlin Tegel Airport via Frankfurt to NewarkAirport. It was just hours before that year&apos;s Consensus conference inTime Square&apos;s Marriott Marquis would take place and as the productmanager of BigchainDB, I had no idea what I had gotten myself into.</p><p>I landed real &quot;poor but sexy&quot; by boarding a direct bus shuttle toManhattan from Newark. And then what followed were a few days of totalcraziness.</p><p>Already at seven in the morning of the show&apos;s first day, our boothgot drowned in visitors. &quot;They&apos;re crazy!&quot; was all my colleague had tocontribute to the crowd&apos;s engagement.</p><p>And soon a personal problem I couldn&apos;t have anticipated was thefragility of my voice becoming softer as it started fading from theconstant screaming-level I had to retain by communicating on theMarriott&apos;s trade floor.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/uasf.jpeg" alt="UASF (long: &quot;user activated soft fork&quot;)"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">UASF (long: &quot;user activated softfork&quot;)</figcaption></figure><p>I remember these days as specially weird. Particularly, findingmyself in an elevator full of UASF-wearing Bitcoin maxis, or to beentangled in rather casual conversations with Bushwick&apos;s nouveaurich.</p><p>Also, there&apos;s this party night on a skyscraper&apos;s rooftop. And somedialogues:</p><p><strong>I asked him</strong> what he does for a living, and heanswered that he worked for the people throwing the party.</p><p>&quot;Ah, really? And what do you do?&quot;; I followed up.</p><p>&quot;I work for EOS!&quot; he claimed.</p><p>&quot;EOS?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, EOS, the Ethereum killer.&quot;</p><p>Another memory is later, when she pointed to a guy and said: &quot;That&apos;shim, that&apos;s the DAO hacker!&quot;</p><p>Most of it, just blurry memories today.</p><p>But what truly happened during those days was the discovery of thecryptosphere new favorite toy: <em>tokens</em>. All the summer, they hadbeen the rage. They were confirmed through Bitcoin&apos;s steady climb andcemented in to history those days Ethereum&apos;s price simply startedexploding.</p><p>Tokens, they called them, and suddenly everything looked like a nail.It did to me too. And it was hard to get at first.</p><p>&quot;What to make of them?&quot; I thought. &quot;Tokens? Coins? And for what?&quot;Those days, my mind got stuck finding parallels to Bitcoin. Those daysit started wandering. &quot;So, if we want to have tokens for another projectbut Bitcoin: Wouldn&apos;t it mean that we&apos;d either have to repurpose theProof of Work algorithm or invent another utility deliveringalgorithm?&quot;</p><p>Months later, I found myself trying to model a utility token. It justseemed logical: I was an engineer, and here was a tool that could helpme to engineer more.</p><p>But it came different than I expected.</p><p>Given how galvanized we were, we pivoted the company. But contrary tomy expectations, we didn&apos;t start designing our software to encompasstokens. In fact, noone else did either.</p><p>I started looking around, and all I saw were tokens. Tokens tokenstokens. Every investor wanted them; many tech people seemed cool withthem too. So what could be wrong?</p><p>But nobody really got what we were supposed to do with them. Sure,there were occasionally brilliant moments that led to interestingdesigns. Case in point, TCRs (long: &quot;token curated registries&quot;). Buteven after months, everything had remained how I had initially observedit.</p><p>A token&apos;s first principle existence wasn&apos;t meant to exponentiateengineering. Instead, I and others found myself observing waves of VCspushing for tokenization with seemingly no reason but to collect funds.Suddenly, what I thought of as an engineer&apos;s tool became a framework forflipping wealth from poor to rich overnight.</p><p>&quot;Just launch a token; use our SAFT. 10 easy steps to ICO.&quot;</p><p>I tried going along with it. After all, what could be so bad? But thedust stirred up those days didn&apos;t settle, and tokens didn&apos;t end upmaking sense. I mean, they did: But only in a very narrow engineeringsense. Super tough engineering, designing utility machines. A conceptbusiness-types weren&apos;t interested in or capable of seeing at the time.Maybe not capable of seeing today.</p><p>And so, when I saw that we put the token before the product: Iquit.</p><hr><p>In 2021, most tokens are still speculative nonsense. Most companieslaunch a token and then try to build a product - many fail to build aproduct. Many fail to incorporate their token in a meaningful way. Don&apos;tbe those companies.</p><p>Think rationally and resist forced tokenization. Take a criticalstance.</p><p>Think logically, remove your ego and most importantly: don&apos;t let yourcapital (desires) influence your engineering decisions. Code is speechand you are capable of more than just increasing your personalwealth.</p><p>Also: Your token doesn&apos;t have utility just because you say so.</p><p>You can be braver. Just build what needs building and ignore thebs.</p><p>Do what&apos;s good and reasonable - for everyone. And not only for thosethat hold the token.</p><p>Because tokens in software design considered harmful.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/emperor.jpg"></p><p>I&apos;ll cut right to the chase: I believe a big reason why many peoplein this world suffer is because some other people can afford to decideirrationally.</p><p>In &quot;Was ist Autorit&#xE4;t?&quot; (en.: &quot;What is authority?&quot;) Bochenski, theauthor, divides authority into two distinct categories. Authority, heclaims, is a relationship between e.g. two parties and a domain, whereone party acknowledges the authority of another over the domain.</p><p>However, Bechenski makes a remarkable categorization of authoritieswithin the book. He generally divides authority into <em>epistemic</em>and <em>deontic</em> and specifies that:</p><ul><li>an <em>epistemic</em> authority (= &quot;relating to knowledge&quot;) says it&quot;<em>how it is</em>&quot;; whereas</li><li>a <em>deontic</em> authority (= &quot;relating to duty and obligation)says it &quot;<em>how it should be</em>&quot;.</li></ul><p>I find these categories remarkable as they also help to get a clearerpicture when, for example, working with software. I&apos;d go even furtherand say that many conflicts in developing software stem from denying orbeing unaware of this power dynamic.</p><p>If, for example, you browse blog posts on Hacker News, then you&apos;lloften come across the type of developer that hates meetings and theirmanager. The brisance in the relationship to their manager, I&apos;ve come toobserve, often stems from failing to differentiate between<em>epistemic</em> and <em>deontic</em> authority.</p><p>It&apos;s because generally, the developer bases their arguments on&quot;<em>how things are</em>&quot;, whereas the manager is commissioned to makethings &quot;<em>how they should be</em>&quot;. Put more simply, the developer isan epistemic authority to the manager, but the manager is a deonticauthority to the developer.</p><p>And while you might think that, hence, there shouldn&apos;t be a problemas surely things between devs and managers will balance out over time,acknowledging the anecdotal reality is that I&apos;ve never read an angrymanager&apos;s blog.</p><p>So I&apos;d argue that the reason I&apos;ve never seen a manager&apos;s mad blog isthat they, being the deontic authority, always get their way by beingalso in control of the project&apos;s funds and hence the dev. So even thoughthings &quot;<em>are</em>&quot;, they&apos;re made as they &quot;<em>should</em>&quot;.</p><h2 id="on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes">On-chain, the Emperorwears no Clothes</h2><p>Now, to deliver on this article&apos;s headline, which reads why&quot;on-chain, the emperor wears no clothes,&quot; I think it&apos;s of vitalimportance to understand the difference in the types of authorities.It&apos;s because in the colorful world of ERC20s, who controls the token,controls the money and hence puts themselves into the deontic authorityposition towards others.</p><p>Suddenly, things can&apos;t be done in a rational way anymore: The&quot;<em>how it is</em>&quot; stops being acknowledged. The &quot;<em>how it shouldbe</em>&quot; becomes more relevant. And that&apos;s where, in my opinion, thesuffering for epistemic authorities starts.</p><h2 id="authorative-development">Authorative Development</h2><p>It is my conviction any type of software we use today is based onepistemology and not deontology. It&apos;s because deontology can&apos;t informepistemology.</p><p>It may be concluded that indeed the world is better should 2 + 1 = 4,but deontology doesn&apos;t carry the same power as reason and epistemology.Deontology can only be accomplished through force and continuouspreaching.</p><p>Epistemology, on the other hand, appears in humans beings as afundamental feeling. In a way, it could be seen as the most powerfulappliance of empathy.</p><p>It&apos;s because if we explain math to someone and succeed in making themunderstand, then through this act of understanding, we transferredknowledge. We haven&apos;t had to use force. We didn&apos;t need to preach. Theperson comprehended the knowledge through the feeling of discovery. Thatperson, taught epistemically, can now go out in the world and startteaching others.</p><p>With deontic reasoning, on the other hand, we can&apos;t gain this levelof sustainability. To enforce the &quot;<em>should</em>&quot;, we&apos;ll have to stayin control and exercise power. If our student was to escape and roam theworld, they may now run the risk of being exposed to knowledge. Thenwhat?</p><p>Well eventually, I&apos;d argue, that knowledge and &quot;<em>what is</em>&quot;would start overwriting the forcefully fed &quot;<em>should</em>&quot;. One day,all preachings would be gone and worst of all, our student wouldn&apos;t beable to transfer any of the &quot;<em>should</em>&quot;. At worst, they&apos;d knowless &quot;<em>what is</em>&quot; and start therefore start immitating theirinfamous teacher.</p><p>So you ask why I claim that &quot;on-chain, the emperor wear no clothes?&quot;I tell you, it&apos;s because his emperor&apos;s tailors were so blinded by theshiny value of their ERC20 tokens, they stopped seing &quot;<em>what is</em>&quot;and only did what they ought.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past, when the crypto space had been in a bubble, during mytimes on crypto Twitter (short: &quot;CT&quot;), one popularly debated questionhad always been that about &quot;inflated expectations.&quot; The classic Gartnerhype cycle chart informs where the debate stems from.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/hypecycle.png" alt="Gartner Hypecycle Curve with Annotations"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Gartner Hypecycle Curve withAnnotations</figcaption></figure><p>The line of thinking is this: If indeed, we can rationally prove thatthere are inflated expectations towards the bubbling technology market,then we can conclude being in a bubble and adjust our financialbets.</p><p>On CT in 2018, this led to many long nights of productive debates andeventually, the masses indeed reached a conclusion: blockchaintechnology wasn&apos;t ready for prime time yet. And so what followed was ameteoric period dubbed the &quot;crypto winter&quot;, a time and environment whereonly the strongest saplings ended up thriving in what became known asthe &quot;DeFi summer.&quot;</p><p>And while it was fairly regular seeing anime-avatared accounts makingimpressively reasonable contributions to the cryptocurrency space, whathadn&apos;t been the case yet was animes founding top projects.</p><p>The whole space fit some arbitrary city&apos;s convention center andpeople genuinely knew each other beyond just the awkward conferencesmall talk. Getting accustomed to the Ethereum community in 2018 almostfelt like becoming part of a big clique or family. These bonds, Ibelieve, are what made it so successful as we came for the smartcontracts - but stayed for the fam.</p><p>However, during DeFi summer and with the space&apos;s insane growth, thatsocial dynamic changed. Not intentionally and for sure quite gradually,but it did. The relevancy of anime-anons grew and with that also theirproject&apos;s significance. Practically overnight, (hostile?) forks likeSushiSwap - founded and maintained by anons - emerged as real threats totheir clear-named counterpart: Uniswap.</p><p>Albeit its impact being controversially discussed, rumor had it thatto counter Sushi, Uniswap, merely as a damage-controlling measure,launched its own governance token UNI. And today?</p><p>The space&apos;s state is that SushiSwap - a project without anytraditional business foundation - generating weekly revenues of $1Mthrough transaction fee collection; still consists of few withclear-named appearance while, in the meantime, its compliant olderbrother, Uniswap, found itself recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-sec-investigates-crypto-exchange-developer-uniswap-labs-wsj-2021-09-03/">becomingunder scrutiny</a> by the world&apos;s most powerful financial regulator: TheUnited States Security and Exchange Commission.</p><p>And that&apos;s the point where I believe we must backtrack and askourselves the delicate question posed at this article&apos;s beginning;bubbles and <em>inflated expectations</em>.</p><p>If tokenization and compliance is indeed a commercial detriment thatleads to persecution and not tolerance, then won&apos;t we see the trend ofcrypto project <strong>anonymization</strong> accelerate? Or, instead,will we all - with the help of our lord and savior, the constitutionalstate - be guided towards the light and realize that the best bet tofreedom and peace is <strong>detokenization</strong>?</p><p>Being a crypto company founder (<a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>) with an activeclear-name avatar myself; my thoughts are this: Though I&apos;m hugely infavor of secularizing the relationship of state and currency control, Iconcede to the idea that large parts of the world should remain underthe authority of <em>a</em> state.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it has ever been crypto&apos;s aspiration to legislate atomspace. Counter to that; it has actually continued to expand cyberspaceinto a now fully-functioning parallelized digital economy that wasoriginally bootstrapped by Bitcoin and the likes. There&apos;s a reason that&quot;you don&apos;t need a blockchain&quot; in &quot;real-life&quot; applications. It&apos;s becauseblockchain wasn&apos;t and isn&apos;t built for &quot;real&quot;; It&apos;s <em>cyber</em>.</p><p>Then, thinking conceptually about this parallel economy, I think thestate is right to have some entitlement about controlling the space&apos;sborders. And logically, it&apos;s why today we pay tax when selling crypto tofiat. However, I do feel that the state has started falsely takingresponsibility when it started regulating what it cannot control.</p><p>On countless websites of countless states, the message is clear: Beprepared to lose it all when investing your money in crypto. Hence, howcan then also exist a mandate to regulate the &quot;illegal&quot; issuance of&quot;securities&quot; when indeed the reality is that ERC20 tokens are beingissued on Ethereum, a globally distributed ledger?</p><p>Couldn&apos;t we consider a nation-state &quot;illegally leaving its sovereignterritory&quot; if it started policing a globally distributed project incyberspace? Sure, the counterargument would be that the internet is acollection of routers, switches and cables controlled by yours truly;But to me, that&apos;s neither a technical requirement anymore nor is itinforming the question of policing. Wouldn&apos;t e.g., the US literallyoverstep borders if it started policing a globally distributed cryptoproject?</p><p>As a founder in the space, these questions are indeed of <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/05/22/ethereum-layer2-scaling-rollups-dapps-sidechains/">existential</a>matter. How <em>must</em> one behave in the face of thesedevelopments?</p><p>I, too, have had countless anonymous accounts and even launched minorprojects with them. But have I been excited about them? Not that much.See, I didn&apos;t want and I still don&apos;t want to take the legal risk ofanonymously contributing to DeFi. Neither do I want to physically moveto a crypto-friendly jurisdiction either.</p><p>Ironically, on a technical level, I&apos;d be capable of doing what thespace&apos;s most successful are doing, but I&apos;m hesitant about getting myhands dirty.</p><p>With my clear-named startup <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>, I can&apos;t legallylaunch tokens in Germany; I mean, I could - but it&apos;d be so capital andtime-intensive that there wouldn&apos;t be a point. As an anon, I&apos;d becapable - but could I make a living from crypto alone without becomingpart of a parallel society? And don&apos;t I strive for recognition too?</p><p>So then, doesn&apos;t the original question framed at the beginningremain? Is the cryptocurrency market&apos;s evaluation subject to inflatedexpectations?</p><p>If crypto and DeFi are truly that great for innovation now, isn&apos;t itkind of ironic that after nine months of work, I&apos;m starting to realizethat my project&apos;s challenges don&apos;t lie within technology but are made oflegal uncertainty?</p><p>Call me attached to my meaty identity, but I&apos;d rather<em>detokenize</em> than <em>anonymize</em>.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In software engineering, when there&apos;s a lack of budget or time, we dothings improperly. I&apos;d argue that for most code I&apos;ve written, there&apos;s ahidden ideal of that code failing to come to fruition. Objectivelyspeaking, any code can hardly be ideal. As there&apos;s no universallyaesthetic poem or an infinitely funny joke (except in the Monty Pythonuniverse), so is there no hyper-functional piece of code.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBWr1KtnRcI" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Funnily enough, we engineers, hence, say that when code passes fromdevelopment into production that it has become &quot;<em>legacy</em>.&quot;Legacy, herein, is being used as a synonym for the financial term ofliability.</p><p>Legacy code is problematic as it can slow us down in the present, asit can forcefully direct budgets towards maintenance and since itsstructure mandates what is and possibly can be.</p><p>But when, during development, we take deliberate shortcuts to pumpcode into production with more velocity, then this type of behavior maylater qualify as <em>incurring technical debt</em>.</p><p>Having had no professional background in any financial domain, as ajunior software engineer, I liked to talk about technical debt asexactly described above. I&apos;d think that a bad piece of code thatrequires maintenance symbolizes technical debt. Never did I dive intothe epistemic definition of the term: <strong>debt</strong>. Why would I- debt had never been a relatable topic of mine.</p><p>But more recently, by taking on more financial work through building<a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>, I&apos;ve come torealize the powerfulness of painting the full picture that is<em>technical debt</em>. On my walk here, it came to my mind that fortechnical debt to incur, the <em>borrower</em> must engage in adeliberate process of <em>collateralizing a piece of <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/06/18/when-scope-blows-up/">scope</a></em>.</p><p>In practical terms, what this may mean is that, e.g., a softwareengineer neglects unit testing their code. Considering that unit testsincrease confidence about a software&apos;s correction after changes occur,now suddenly the SE (or borrower) traded in future confidence forimproved short-term progress. If suddenly no testing is required,adjusting a small piece of software is quicker and cheaper to send intoproduction.</p><p>However, the catch is that now their debt position startsaccumulating <em>negative interest</em>. In case a month later, theengineer wants to make another change to the code, it now means thatadjusting it already became more complex. Since no tests are availableand because their memories about the code&apos;s functionality have faded,how can the engineer ship the adjusted code into production withconfidence?</p><p>They can&apos;t. And the most damning part is that at this stage, manyengineers fold, accept their fate and start incurring even moredebt.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/debt-spiral-sausage.jpg" alt="When I googled &quot;debt spiral&quot;, this royalty free image of a sausage came up."><figcaption aria-hidden="true">When I googled &quot;debt spiral&quot;, thisroyalty free image of a sausage came up.</figcaption></figure><p>And that&apos;s the ingenuity I found when thinking about technical debt.Not only is it a synonym for a piece of code that is bad. Rather it&apos;s aterm to express that a few lines may carry huge liabilities for whoeverhas taken responsibility to maintain them. It&apos;s really debt, in thefinancial sense. Except that its deleveraging will take place throughvarious proxies.</p><p>But the real reason I sat down to write this blog post wasn&apos;t becauseof technical debt. But because, logically, when there&apos;s debt -<strong>there also has to be technical interest or yield</strong>.</p><p>So in a way, it&apos;s funny that many of us are constantly obsessed withcontinuous shipping, when instead, clearly, there&apos;s also<strong>yield</strong> to be harvested from great engineering. Andintuitively, I believe it exists. There&apos;s definitely that one brilliantand well-oiled machine producing incredible yield for its owner.</p><p>My mind wanders from the image of a combustion engine to theinvention of higher-level programming languages and computers and to allthe brilliant physical and chemical breakthroughs that allowed us toengineer around many of our life&apos;s inconveniences. I&apos;m thinking of thethousands of hours that planes are in the air without crashing much. Thecountless lifes that have been safed by airbags. Refrigerators, washingmachines, light bulbs.</p><p>Initially, many things were likely produced, incurring technicaldebt. However, seeing the immaculacy of some engineered concepts: Ican&apos;t think but believe that when there&apos;s technical debt, there&apos;s alsothe option for technical yield.</p><p>And so I hope through this rhetorical discovery, in the future, I&apos;llcode more things properly to <strong>stack yield and notdebt</strong>.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks for reading.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Would you do it?" src="/assets/images/downloadacar.png" style="height: 15em;"></p><p>Or would you?</p><p>Experiencing another surge in NFT demand, we now logically see allsorts of companies publishing their latest tech research on how toregister and trade intellectual property (short &quot;IP&quot;) on-chain. The mainidea they all follow is:</p><ul><li>Register or &quot;anchor&quot; an IP&apos;s manifestation on-chain. And then;through its distinct registration;</li><li>make it tradable as an NFT on platforms like <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a> for speculation orconsumption.</li></ul><p>If you&apos;re a reader of my blog - by now I think you&apos;ve gotten thehints that I&apos;m not a believer. In my last post, I said that &quot;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/07/21/nfts-are-coming-for-instagram/">NFTsare coming for Instagram and other social media platforms</a>&quot; and thattheir <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/">provenancecan be tampered with</a>. I&apos;m tripling down. NFTs have nothing to dowith the legal concept of intellectual property. Putting IP on theblockchain is missing the point. Nobody needs that.</p><p>But I&apos;m discontent even further with the space&apos;s view on intellectualproperty. From a philosophical point of view mainly. Let me explain.</p><h3 id="been-there-done-that">Been there, done that</h3><p>Five years ago, I co-authored a document on intellectual propertylicensing and blockchain. As this work ended up being published in theCOALA working group, we called it the &quot;<a href="https://github.com/COALAIP/specs">COALA IP Specification</a>.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ll spare you the long read and say: it&apos;s essentially a year&apos;s worthof research on intellectual property licensing and how organizationsmanage to digitize it in data structures. The document ended up being aself-glorified and unfinished recommendation for how to most genericallymodel data structures that encompass all sorts of legal concepts and howto store those on blockchain-ish systems.</p><p>Today, I&apos;d argue that the specification&apos;s value didn&apos;t lie increating the document itself - albeit it now has over 100 stars onGitHub (lol). Instead, I think most valuable about the effort wasaccumulating the experience of promoting and writing about the concept.Here&apos;s why:</p><p>The specification itself just tries to piece together a data modelfrom, at the time, commonly appreciated frameworks. Many of us were intoontologies and linked data. It&apos;s why the spec is heavily reliant onschema.org, JSON Linked Data, and other &quot;promising&quot; technologies thatended up nowhere. However, it defined two concepts that have becomewidely adopted in decentralized apps:</p><ul><li>The anchoring of data to prove its existence at a specific moment intime.</li><li>The mapping of some internal blockchain functionalities onto legalcontracts (e.g., transferring an NFT means &quot;transfer of IPrights&quot;).</li></ul><p>Curiously, a subset of the problems we tried to solve were lateraddressed by practical implementations like <a href="https://zora.co">Zora</a>, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. Their core functionalitydeliberately doesn&apos;t rely on intellectual property licensing forachieving functionality. Instead they&apos;ve made it irrelevant by smartlyapplying emerging technologies.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/zora.png" alt="Zora.co is a &quot;Decentralized Auction Protocol&quot; - take that boomers!"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Zora.co is a &quot;Decentralized AuctionProtocol&quot; - take that boomers!</figcaption></figure><p>So why is it that the COALA IP approach never struck a nerve? I&apos;d saythat it&apos;s because it never managed to capture the Internet&apos;s Zeitgeist.And because it applied the intellectual concept too directly.</p><h3 id="zeitgeist-did-you-mean-timeghost">Zeitgeist? &quot;Did you mean<em>timeghost</em>?&quot;</h3><p>By now it should have become clear that our technology visionariesaren&apos;t venturing towards a perfectly interoperable system regardingadjacent technologies and institutions. A smart contract hasintentionally nothing to do with a paper contract. Sure, occasionally,there&apos;s another one of these boring blockchain conference panels wherethe same people discuss the meaning of &quot;code is law&quot; for theseven-hundredths time - but on a technical level, truly nobody caresabout establishing compatibility.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/coleslaw.jpeg" alt="&quot;Code is law&quot; (short: &quot;Coleslaw&quot;)"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">&quot;Code is law&quot; (short:&quot;Coleslaw&quot;)</figcaption></figure><p>But that&apos;s true also for the system&apos;s users. For the most part, theinternet has stopped caring about intellectual property. There&apos;s noangry Metallica frontman that wants to stop us from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU">downloading cars</a>.And there are also no law firms wanting thousands of dollars because youaccidentally seeded an mp3 for a night. You just use Netflix andSpotify.</p><p>It&apos;s simply that the idea of what constitutes &quot;online media&quot; hasshifted from something object-like or file-like to somethingperformance-like. We&apos;ve accepted that the concept of materiality isn&apos;tuseful in bits and only applicable in atoms.</p><p>But in the wonderful world of copyright, things haven&apos;t shifted thatmuch. Here, from immaterial sources, material goods can be produced byprinting paper with black English letters and by using magical physicalsignatures and stamps. Ink, ... fucking stamps? How do they work???</p><div class="owl-media owl-video owl-youtube"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8bhYMnHb5JY" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Instead of dealing with the shortcomings of this annoying piece oflegacy, the industries of intellectual properties have moved on todifferent things. Brand-building and brand deals, advertisements, mainlyperformance-based and ephemeral outputs. Remember when it was cool tocatch the drum stick of your favorite rock band&apos;s drummer? No? Well, meneither.</p><p>Personally, all creators I care about today: I&apos;ve never even metthem. I&apos;ve never possessed any material or object-like piece of them. Idon&apos;t even feel like wanting to either. I don&apos;t worship their work fortheir objective output like I did years ago when I went to the store tobuy me the new Linkin Park LP.</p><p>Instead, these days, fandom has become an act of engagement. I helpto enhance my favorite artist&apos;s performance online. I promote, react,mention, share, and like their content.</p><h3 id="we-need-new-tools">We need new tools</h3><p>I also can&apos;t blame anyone for making the same mistakes I did whenfirst wanting to make the internet more creator-friendly. As adeveloper, if you&apos;d look into how intellectual property is laid out froma legal perspective, inevitably, you&apos;d come up with a solution thatanchors and maps actions onto blockchain functions.</p><p>However, it&apos;s important to realize that this way of looking atintellectual property is becoming irrelevant today. Sure, you can say:&quot;<em>But this is literally how all the industry works right now!</em>&quot;and you wouldn&apos;t be wrong. But it&apos;d also show that you&apos;re ignoring thereality of what it means to create today. Creation transferred from anact of materialization to a performance.</p><p>In open-source, a public repository is just as useful as itscommunity of maintainers. On Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitchyou&apos;ll only find success through building a permanent onlinepersonality. Clubhouse is for sharing hot air and that is the definitionof ephermeral.</p><p>Almost no creators&apos; works are truly protected by copyright andintellectual property licensing. Mostly, they&apos;re protected by thecreator&apos;s aura of authenticity and by owning and monetizing an audience.Sure - occasionally, a video can end up in places where it shouldn&apos;t.And it&apos;s then rightfully disputed through the platform&apos;s mechanism. Butlet&apos;s be real: The platform&apos;s motivation, at that point, is ratherupkeeping of consistency than righting a wrongful IP licensing.</p><p>IP is mostly irrelevant.</p><p>Given the Internet&apos;s real-time nature, I think we&apos;ll see even moretools emerge that monkeypatch the legal licensing of digitalartifacts.</p><hr><p><em><strong>please consider subscribing to my news letter if youenjoyed reading this piece</strong></em></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&apos;ll admit it; I did some good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shoulder_surfing_(computer_security)&amp;oldid=1023421734">shouldersurfing</a> on my flight back to Berlin the other day. The next bit iskinda spicy, but I&apos;ll anyways tell you about it: On the flight, therewas this guy in a pink hoodie sitting one seat in front and to the rightof me. He held his phone at a height where it leveled with his eyes, andso sitting in a middle seat myself - I didn&apos;t even have much of a choiceother than <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:A_Clockwork_Orange#V">viddying</a>his Instagram browsing habits.</p><p>It was when we were approaching Berlin&apos;s new airport &quot;BER,&quot; and sohere we were - all tucked into our seats - seatbelts fastened and thisone douche checking his Instagram during our approach to the airport.Though this is very tangential to the story, he had disabled AirplaneMode on his phone early to use his mobile data inflight - we were stillhundreds of meters in the air. So while the pilots were busy having thebird touch Berlin soil gently, my guy in front started checking out hisInsta.</p><p>And frankly, nothing out of the ordinary happened on that screen -there were the obligatory pictures of hot girls in bikinis. Some humbleshots of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:A_Clockwork_Orange#B">bugatties</a>on yachts and a general &quot;dolce vita&quot; vibe with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_hour_(photography)&amp;oldid=1033749526">goldenhour</a> filters left and right. But in between, there were the targetedads. And to my surprise, these were mega-effective. So effective thatupon our plane reaching the airport&apos;s gate - the guy had put severalitems into his &quot;Ralph Lauren&quot; shopping cart.</p><p>Well, Hannes - if you&apos;re reading this - I wish you all the best funwearing that sick blue polo shirt at your next yachty party (we were ona Ryanair flight).</p><p>And though, I found this experience rather striking - it wasn&apos;t myintention specifically to expose that guy&apos;s Instagram browsing habits inthis post. Rather, I wanted to draw a picture of contemporary Instagramusage in 2021 and then compare it to what is happening withcryptocurrencies these days, lol.</p><p>The connection leading to this story originates from a talk show Irecently watched, featuring Hito Steyerl, Joseph Vogel and VilleHaimala. It&apos;s the most recent episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btQRji5fU_8">Studio Bonn</a> on&quot;Crypto-Capitalism&quot;.</p><p>I won&apos;t spoiler any of the content here except for saying that Ville,being a member of the band Amnesia Scanner, made a statement aboutcomparing NFTs to Instagram posts. Specifically, he remarked that theirdata structure allows NFTs to be platform-independent social media. Sowhereas all posts on Instagram are constantly at the mercy of itsarbitrary moderation policy and the assumed continuity of the service&apos;sexistence - an NFT transcends these weak points by storing the media&quot;off-platform&quot; and by making its access and meta data interoperable.</p><p>That comparison struck me as profound. It did so as I had beenworking for years on an intellectual property licensing framework called<a href="https://www.coalaip.org/">COALA IP</a> to allow digitizingCopyright claims and licensing deals on blockchains. I&apos;ll admit thatthroughout my journey within <a href="https://ascribe.io">ascribe.io</a>, working with smaller projectslater on and even trying to build an <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC-721</a><a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/ERC721-wallet">wallet</a> myself - Ihad to face many frustrating blockers with regards to Ethereum&apos;s way ofimplementing NFTs.</p><p>And hence, just before the big NFT craze in 2021, in 2020, I stoppedworking on it. To me, that standard, the ERC-721, didn&apos;t seem useful forwhat I was trying to achieve. And indeed, I ended up doubling down onthat believe by <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/">publiclyremarking that an NFT&apos;s provenance won&apos;t guarantee the authenticity manythink it does</a>.</p><p>Today, by writing this post, I feel more confirmed by contemplatingVille&apos;s statement of comparing the NFT standard to an interoperableInstagram post. Indeed, it&apos;s a perfect fit.</p><p>Yes, you may attribute value to an NFT by selling it on amarketplace. Yes, that value may be astronomical and irrational today.And indeed, the properties of atoms is different than the one of bits.But if you misjudge the relevance of these properties - I think you maymiss one particularly important observation.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/stealingthescream.gif" alt="Copying the picture of &quot;The Scream&quot; many times on my computer (2015)"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Copying the picture of &quot;The Scream&quot; manytimes on my computer (2015)</figcaption></figure><p>The data structure of an NFT is strikingly similar to that of anInstagram, Facebook, or Twitter post. It&apos;s a link to a media element,e.g., an image or a video and a description - all that meta data is thenrelated to a particular identity, your Ethereum address, or ENSname.</p><p>Yes, there&apos;s no distinct feed that lets you like or retweet an NFTyet. Today, NFTs don&apos;t &quot;look and feel&quot; instagramish. There&apos;s also a lackof targeted ads and probably hence also a void of golden hour LuisVuitton yacht photos. But that&apos;s because the current NFT infrastructure,unlike Instagram&apos;s, doesn&apos;t reward creators for being on yachts wearingexpensive clothes. It&apos;s not about fake it till you make it - the idea ofNFTs is to reward credibility and provenance.</p><p>So indeed, I&apos;d conclude for today that the NFT data structure is theperfect technical and conceptual foundation for building a freeInstagram, Facebook, or Twitter.</p><p>It does so by making social media posts platform-independent andabstracting the ownership and accessibility layer away from theplatforms and into the hands of creators and fans.</p><p>So don&apos;t worry - NFTs are NOT coming to &quot;revolutionize the artmarket&quot; - funnily enough, they&apos;re coming with full force to disrupt theattention monopoly of Facebook, Twitter, and other social mediaplatforms. And though that was something I never anticipated ordeliberately worked towards in my work - I can&apos;t wait for that tohappen.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In software engineering, there&apos;s an infamous but reoccurringsituation, I think is relatable for every developer and project manager.You&apos;re never safe from it. It can assault you at any moment: During apeaceful standup, when reading issues on GitHub, or during lunch withco-workers. It&apos;s when <strong>the scope blows up</strong> having creptinto your project&apos;s issues and code - mercilessly expanding and drivingeveryone nuts: <strong>&quot;OMG, WE HAVE SCOPE CREEP!&quot;</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/images/shockedstoner.gif"></p><p>First, let&apos;s take a step back and define what is meant by scopecreep. Intentionally, I&apos;ll focus on defining it from a manager&apos;sperspective because that&apos;s where I suspect it originates. So what isscope? I&apos;d say that scope is the sum of all things needed to deliver asoftware product given a specific set of expectations and a date.</p><p>If we want to build an instant messenger app, its scope would likelyencompass a feature that allows sending messages to others. Maybe it&apos;dinclude sending smilies. Or photos. But what about voice calls? Well,that&apos;s where thinking in terms of scope becomes useful. If we deem thatvoice calls aren&apos;t part of our product offerings, we&apos;d consider it<strong>&quot;out of scope.&quot;</strong> That&apos;s when we&apos;d say that &quot;we&apos;vediscovered scope creep&quot; or that &quot;scope is blowing up.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s curious to see that the English Wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scope_(project_management)&amp;oldid=1016322255">Scope(project management)</a> is tiny, considering how fundamental theconcept seems to be in software engineering these days. Given this lackof rigid facts, however, I feel happy to just reason from my experiencein the extension of this article. Continuing, I&apos;ll just shoot from thehip.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/shootingfromthehip.png"></p><p>Here&apos;s a non-verified claim: Scope creep is subject to Murphy&apos;s law.So if scope can increase, it will increase. I&apos;m not sure why that is,and indeed some behavioral psychologists have one day have an excellentexplanation; but for now, you&apos;ll have to take it for what I&apos;ve observed.I&apos;ve said - when scope creeps, it&apos;s when everyone loses their minds.</p><p>But why? What is so bad about scope creep that people blame it fortheir company&apos;s failure, for leaving a job, or for burning out? It suresounds like it encompasses incredible risk. And I think it does.</p><p>For a project manager and their team that&apos;s bound to deliver aroadmap, scope creep can make them look like failures and potentiallylead to them missing out on future funding. Scope creep can mean the endof a project.</p><p>It&apos;s because for outsiders, given a lack of equal distribution ofinformation about the project&apos;s challenges, scope creep can look like ateam is failing or having lost focus. &quot;Why are they not able to delivertheir roadmap?&quot;, &quot;This one feature, what does it have to do with theproduct&apos;s main value proposition?&quot; &quot;It looks like they&apos;re failing.&quot;</p><p><img src="/assets/images/spongebobchaos.gif"></p><p>While, of course, from the inside, things can look dramaticallydifferent. Scope creep is seldom god&apos;s irrational punishment for theteam&apos;s sins (<em>lol dunno why I wrote that</em>). Indeed, scope creepmay just be the difference between expectations and reality. It may justbe a specific lack of information. It may be a few thousand missing inthe budget or the lack of a specific team mate.</p><p>I don&apos;t think, however, that scope creep is ever unjustified. Everyscope creeper has a reason for creeping. It may be that their proposalis flawed and unnecessarily blown up. But ultimately, assuming that allcontributors are good-natured towards the project, I&apos;ve made theexperience that a scope creeper (a person that blows up scope) islooking at the problem from a unique point of view and is seeingsomething others aren&apos;t.</p><p>I&apos;d argue that as software engineers, we should embrace blowing upscope more. And we should learn to work with it. I know it sounds crazy,but your software management process can adapt to extracting immensevalue from knowledge processes by appropriately managing creepingscope.</p><p>I encourage you to think about scope creep like this: It&apos;s when youfound a problem so vast and sinister that none of your team dares toface and slay it. It may be so huge; other teams may not dare toconfront it either. Hell, it may be so colossal NOBODY HAS EVERdared.</p><p>But in turn, what does this mean economically? It means that you&apos;releaving value behind. See, today&apos;s internet is oversaturated with lifehacks, workarounds, and quick fixes. It&apos;s good because it lets you focuson the task at hand. It&apos;s bad because it makes us believe that focusingon the short-term is appropriate for solving problems. We&apos;re leavingvalue behind, an example:</p><p>Maybe you&apos;ve used a tool like docker before, and given itscomplexity, at one point, you discovered this annoying bug. You couldsolve it yourself - but you fear it&apos;d blow up your project&apos;s scope.</p><p>Upon searching the web, you find a GitHub issue created two yearsago. It now has 1000 comments, and you scroll down to find the mostappropriate workaround that fits your project&apos;s needs.</p><p>Now, considering that 1000 people each wasted one hour of their worktime looking at this issue, I think it&apos;s easy to estimate the problem&apos;sweight. Hypothetically, would you solve it: It&apos;d mean you could cash-inon saving a thousand well-paid developers one hour. Undoubtedly that&apos;s amassive amount of money.</p><p>The problem is: You cannot because it&apos;d mean to blow up your job&apos;sscope ten or a thousandfold. <em>And that&apos;s where I see anissue.</em></p><p>Assuming you&apos;d be able to solve the issue on a technical and economiclevel, you&apos;d progress in your career. But it&apos;s not possible - as there&apos;sneither unlimited budget on your project nor enough time or talent tosubsidize you. So, inevitably, you&apos;ll hence go for the short-termworkaround.</p><p>With all that in mind, I still think there&apos;s the chance to discover adeliberate practice to face scope creep more adventurously. Some scopecreeps will inevitably make the project fail - even if handledcarefully. Others - when solved correctly - may enrich your product andgive you the right edge over the competition.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you read my blog regularly, you&apos;ve probably noticed that I like tocomplain about the state of my favorite cryptocurrency: Ethereum. Itstarted years ago when I claimed that &quot;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2019/02/28/poa/">shipping to a Proof ofAuthority network is a bad idea.</a>&quot; I followed it up with two postsrambling about <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">howEthereum&apos;s design makes it challenging to build excellent webapplications</a> and how its <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">finance-orientedmarket politics ruin dapps for most users as gas prices keeprising</a>.</p><p>The context is that I&apos;m trying to build a decentralized app (short:dapp) myself (<a href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>).In that process, I face challenges that I journal here. Today - bigsurprise - I&apos;m back with another one of these! With one that&apos;s focusedon a pet peeve of mine: Trying to scale with insufficient technologicalsophistication.</p><p>Here&apos;s what&apos;s happening right now in the Ethereum ecosystem: Thoughthe Berlin hard fork and its subsequent block gas limit increase was asuccess, gas fees have continued to be insane. Tangible Layer 2 (short:L2) scaling solutions are <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/">visible on the horizon</a>, butmy vision is blurred - there&apos;s lots of new information to take in andprocess. Having dedicated significant parts of my career towards findingscaling solutions for blockchains: I&apos;m trying to reassess where we are.I can&apos;t say for now. I&apos;ll need more time and dedicate more research.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/ethgasfees.png" alt="Ethereum gas fees of 1000 gwei per gas from May 21, 2021"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Ethereum gas fees of 1000 gwei per gasfrom May 21, 2021</figcaption></figure><p>But here&apos;s the more significant problem: Not being able tostrategically assess what to build and where is a problem in execution.See, in November, <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/12/11/rugpullindex/">I started aproject that rates data sets by their market&apos;s quality</a>. I&apos;d say it&apos;sbeen going well so far for anything but the blockchain-related technicalcomponents. The project&apos;s eventual idea is to create an ERC20 token akinto an index fund&apos;s ETF that holds multiple assets in a specificquantity. Think of <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a> like an S&amp;P500but for data sets instead of American companies.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/rpiscreenshotmay.png" alt="A screenshot of my project&apos;s website in May 2021"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">A screenshot of my project&apos;s website inMay 2021</figcaption></figure><p>I&apos;m burning to make it happen, but I&apos;m struggling to move forward ona technical level. There are no &quot;technical challenges&quot;, as I could buildon the Ethereum mainnet. After all, I&apos;m familiar with the tech, and I&apos;dbe able to code that.</p><p><strong>However, the blocker at this point is of an existentialmatter: How&apos;s Ethereum going to look like in, e.g., three months, oneyear, five years?</strong> How am I supposed to make an informeddecision about building on mainnet when I don&apos;t know where it&apos;s going togo?</p><p>For now, the facts are these: Executing a single on-chain asset swapis in the range of 100k gas. At times, that can be 500 to 1000 USD intransaction fees. Multiply that by 10x, and you have the transaction feefor a single rebalancing of rugpullindex&apos;s fund assuming ten assets.Don&apos;t get me wrong, for sure, is there a way to rationalize that actionby only executing it when it&apos;s economically sound for its users - e.g.,when enough capital uses the index.</p><p>However, the problem is that having my product directly dependent onthe Ethereum mainnet&apos;s performance may impact its safety andquality.</p><p>What if we need to rebalance the index, but the network&apos;s congestioncontinues to increase, making the product&apos;s position permanentlyeconomically unsound? An example: Assume we&apos;ve distributed the indextoken to, say, 20 users. It&apos;s financially sound for them to pay atransaction fee of 5$ / month to rebalance. But then gas pricesincrease, and now suddenly it costs them 50$ / month for the sameservice. Now, for many, it may not be a sound investment anymore. Whatabout the index&apos;s functionality - does it still make sense in thatenvironment?</p><p>Of course, I thought deeply about solutions for this. But thereweren&apos;t a lot of options that came to mind. Here are two tangible thingsthat developers are doing these days to avoid the problem:</p><ol type="1"><li>Ship to a side chain.</li><li>Ship to a rollup.</li></ol><p><strong>About (2) shipping to a rollup</strong>: The problem is thatthey don&apos;t exist yet on the mainnet. I mean, they do exist, butprimarily specialized to a use case.</p><p>I could be building on the beta version of, e.g., Optimism&apos;s L2rollup. That to me, however, is the equivalent of gambling with my timeand focus on the hypothesis that Optimism will indeed ship aconceptually ideal platform for my decentralized app. Don&apos;t get mewrong; I don&apos;t doubt that their product will be great eventually. Butthere&apos;s an undeniable chance that they won&apos;t ship what I need. Andthere&apos;s even a chance that they won&apos;t ship at all. Also, I don&apos;t want tomake bets when building software. I want to base decisions on facts.</p><p><strong>Then, the answer must be in (1)</strong>, shipping to a sidechain-like, e.g., Polygon. But there are even more significant problems.In fact, I find it incredibly short-sighted and inconsiderate of manyprojects in the space to &quot;just&quot; ship to side chains. It&apos;s like takingthe easy way out when uploading your contracts to side chains like xDAI,Polygon, etc..</p><p><a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2019/02/28/poa/">In 2019, I arguedthat the context you in ship matters as it determines your assumptionswhen engineering the product</a>. I want to double down on thatstatement today: When you ship on a side chain, you get a side chainproduct and vice versa. That&apos;s not a new insight but just another facetof <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conway%27s_law&amp;oldid=1024184133">Conway&apos;slaw</a>.</p><p><strong>I think most of us agree that the primary value of theEthereum mainnet, so far, has come from the composability of its smartcontracts, the possibility of projects to cross-pollinate, and itsliquidity</strong>.</p><p>And now I&apos;m supposed to solve high gas fees by shipping on a sidechain? I think we&apos;re deliberately ruining all of the above positives toserve our user&apos;s apparent lust for convenience by shipping onsidechains. I consider such a problem-solving strategy a &quot;don&apos;t.&quot; That&apos;sdevelopment driven by instant gratification and short-term gain. Nothingmore.</p><p>So then, finally, given this existential execution crisis: how am Isupposed to address the issue? My idea: with direct control and aprincipled approach.</p><p>I know that value is concentrating on the most technicallysophisticated network - that being Ethereum L1 mainnet right now. I knowthat L2 is superior from a safety perspective compared to side chains.Transitively, this means that more value will accrue on L2 than on sidechains eventually. I also know that by either building on L1 or L2, I&apos;llbuild my dapp &quot;the right way&quot; (from an assumptions perspective) - butalso: that I&apos;ll remain in control over my application&apos;s executionenvironment when shipping towards the mainnet (either on L1 or L2).</p><p><strong>Finally, it&apos;s essential to realize that I won&apos;t have to shiptowards either option</strong>. I can invent a third option too. And infact, that&apos;s what I&apos;ve started to do.</p><p>If my problem is Ethereum mainnet&apos;s gas prices, then what can I do todecrease them? Recently, I gave suggestions that could cut transactionfees in half for automated market maker apps <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/19/ethereum-web3-saving-gas-mainnet/">byavoiding sending an on-chain <code>approve</code> transaction</a>. Istarted reaching out to L2 builders to learn more about rollups, too.And <a href="https://github.com/rugpullindex/documents/tree/master/research">Ispent a considerable amount of my time recently trying to learn moreabout rollups and layer 2</a>.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/rollupsresearch.png" alt="A drawing from my research on rollups"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">A drawing from my research onrollups</figcaption></figure><p>It&apos;s been an empowering journey of learning so far. I even have anidea of building a rollup-inspired dapp myself now. One that may notneed complicated off-chain consensus. But generally, the idea has beentrying to understand the technology better to improve mydecision-making. I want to optimize the outcomes of my engineering byknowing and understanding the situation as best as I can.</p><p><strong>I want to base decisions on facts, not bets, And that&apos;s whereI am today. Fingers crossed!</strong></p><hr><p>If you enjoyed reading this post and are interested in my Ethereumproject called rugpullindex.com, check out our website and feel free tosign up with the newsletter below.</p><p>Best, Tim</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, while browsing /r/ethereum, I stumbled upon an impersonationattack using NFTs called &quot;sleepminting.&quot; I ended up taking a closer lookas I wanted to understand the idea of the attack. Here&apos;s how itworks.</p><h2 id="the-bait">The Bait</h2><p>Oh, look, it&apos;s beeple&apos;s multi-million dollar piece &quot;<a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x5fbbacf00ef20193a301a5ba20acf04765fb6dac:40914:0xc6b0562605d35ee710138402b878ffe6f2e23807">thefirst 5000 days</a>&quot; for sale on rarible. Check the screenshot, Itclearly says &quot;Creator: beeple.&quot; Wow, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-auction-christies-nft-buyer-idUKKBN2B42MM">Metakovan</a>must have gotten badly rekt having to sell that $69M combo-breaker for ahandful of <a href="https://eth-converter.com/">WEIs</a>.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/rariblesleepminting.png"></p><p>Please don&apos;t fall for it! It&apos;s a scam. Or shall I saw an <a href="https://nftheft.com">art piece</a>? That&apos;s right! Its creator,<strong>Monsieur Personne</strong>, that also goes by theself-proclaimed alter ego <em>The Banksy of NFTs</em>, deliberatelyminted the piece under beeple&apos;s name using a technique he calls<strong>sleepminting</strong>. Why? Because Monsieur is disappointed inNFTs. So how did he do it?</p><h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2><p>NFTs are created using ERC-721 smart contracts. They the ownershiprecord of NFTs as a list of pairs. One address and a piece&apos;s serialnumber make up a pair. Like this (I replaced &quot;Bob&quot; with &quot;Booble&quot;):</p><ul><li>Alice: 1</li><li>Booble: 2</li><li>Malory: 3</li></ul><p>Upon a sale, Alice can transfer her piece to Boople by:</p><ul><li>transfer 1: Alice ==&gt; Booble</li></ul><p>Now, the list of pairs is updated as follows:</p><ul><li>Alice:</li><li>Booble: 2, 1</li><li>Malory: 3</li></ul><p>In Ethereum, we don&apos;t use clear names for identification butaddresses. And we need to sign transfers to authorize them. But in theexamples provided in this post I&apos;ll use clear names to simplifyexplaining.</p><p>Now, usually developers implement ERC-721 contracts in a reasonableway. As we expect Alice can then only transfer a piece if she owns itand can deliver a valid signature. But what happens if a developerdoesn&apos;t respect this convention?</p><p>See, the ERC-721 standard is just a social contract that defines ainterface to allow art platforms to interoperate. There&apos;s no criteriafor what&apos;s a good and what&apos;s a bad implementation. As long as acontract&apos;s interface matches that of an ERC-721 contract, any machine isconsidering it as valid.</p><p>But, as we&apos;ve now seen, that can lead to safety issues with NFTs&apos;provenance on Ethereum. It can be tampered with!</p><h2 id="the-attack">The Attack</h2><p>As I said, any reasonable ERC-721 contract would allow a minter onlyto mint to themselves and to only transfer the pieces they own.</p><p>But say we customize our ERC-721 contract such that we can mint toother accounts. And say that we adjust the transfer function so that ouraccount can, in a minor exception, also transfer another person&apos;spieces. <strong>Well then, we can build a contract that allows us tosleepmint pieces</strong>. So as the attacker Malory, we&apos;d do thefollowing: We&apos;d mint a piece with the serial number 1 to Booble:</p><ul><li>mint 1: address(0) =&gt; Booble (executed by Malory)</li></ul><p>Now our pairs look as follows:</p><ul><li>Alice:</li><li>Booble: 1</li><li>Malory:</li></ul><p>Then, since Malory has adjusted the contract to transfer the piecewith serial number 1 from Booble&apos;s account to any other account, she canoffer it for sale on an NFT platform like rarible.</p><p>As she minted from <code>address(0)</code> to Booble as &quot;Creator:Booble&quot; is displayed.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/rariblesleepminting.png"></p><p>Once Malory successfully deceived a buyer, she receives her Ethersand transfers the piece to the buyer:</p><ul><li>transfer 1: Booble =&gt; Buyer (executed by Malory)</li></ul><p>The updated ownership record now reads:</p><ul><li>Alice:</li><li>Booble:</li><li>Malory:</li><li>Buyer: 1</li></ul><p>And with that, Malory has successfully tampered with the NFT&apos;sprovenance record to sell her piece for more than it&apos;s worth.</p><h2 id="the-specifics">The Specifics</h2><p>So is this attack breaking NFTs? Should you panic sell yourcollection of crypto punks? What about poor Metakovan. He rekt now?</p><p>I&apos;d say no. Sure, rarible and Etherscan state wrongly that beeple hasminted a piece that genuinely he didn&apos;t. However, that&apos;s more of aninterface issue than it is a security vulnerability. Nobody ever hadaccess to beeple&apos;s account.</p><p>Also, the impersonater can be spotted when taking a closer look atthe origin transactions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x57f23fde8e4221174cfb1baf68a87858167fec228d9b32952532e40c367ef04e">Fakemint transaction</a></li><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x57f23fde8e4221174cfb1baf68a87858167fec228d9b32952532e40c367ef04e">Faketransfer transaction</a></li></ul><p>Let&apos;s take a closer look at these transactions.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/etherscansleepminting.png"></p><p>For the mint transaction, we can see that Etherscan displays two&quot;From&quot; fields: One for which <code>msg.sender</code> sent thetransaction and another one to state the NFT&apos;s sender.</p><p>For the transaction&apos;s from field, the <code>msg.sender</code>, it<em>cannot be manipulated</em> as it requires a valid signature from thesender&apos;s private key. The authorization of the &quot;From&quot; field for theNFT&apos;s sender is, however, subject to the smart contract&apos;s implementationand, hence, may not display authenticated information.</p><p>Simply put, the NFT&apos;s sender field could display any data an attackerpicks.</p><p>Hence, to spot a sleepminted piece from an original, one has to checkif both the mint transaction&apos;s sender and the NFT&apos;s sender matchbeeple&apos;s correct address. If not, it&apos;s a fake.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I love this attack. It&apos;s similar to <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rug pulling</a> in that it also playswith the user&apos;s trust towards an online identity. We think, now that weuse blockchain, all our web2 problems are gone. Every piece of data isauthenticated and checked for authorization. But the truth is that theseproblems aren&apos;t gone. They&apos;ve just shifted somewhere else.</p><p>We humans cannot reproduce cryptographic verification in our brains.Sure, we can be extra careful and only trust green checkmarks and locksymbols in user interfaces. But can we recompute hashes of files or thevalidity of a digital signature? No.</p><p>And so the rise of new attacks on web3 is inevitable. I for one amlooking forward to learning from them.</p><hr><h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2><ul><li><a href="/#writing">All posts</a></li><li>2021-08-22: <a href="/2021/08/22/intellectual-property-will-become-irrelevant/">IntellectualProperty Is Becoming Irrelevant</a></li><li>2021-07-21: <a href="/2021/07/21/nfts-are-coming-for-instagram/">NFTs are coming forInstagram and other social media platforms</a></li><li>2021-10-21: <a href="/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">On-chain, TheEmperor Wears No Clothes</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To an Ethereum developer, it shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise thatEthereum&apos;s mainnet gas fees are insane. For months or weeks now, ERC-20transfers and decentralized exchange (short: &quot;DEX&quot;) swaps have come inat roughly $50 in transaction fees. Suddenly finding myself affected bythe situation, too, I took to the pen to publicly claim that &quot;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">Ethereumisn&apos;t fun anymore</a>.&quot; And while some say that <a href="https://github.com/flashbots">flashbots</a> and the rollup rolloutmay make matters more bearable, it&apos;s my opinion that it&apos;ll be anotherwhile.</p><p>But then how&apos;s a practical software engineer supposed to solve thesolution? Indeed, my inner VC would blab something like &quot;<a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/10/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase/">Apps=&gt; Infrastructure =&gt; Apps =&gt; Infrastructure</a>,&quot; but is thatgenuinely actionable advice for builders?</p><p>I&apos;ve tried convincing others that Ethereum&apos;s infrastructure could bebetter. My take: <a href="https://rugpullindex.com/blog#ScalingEthereumOneTxAtATime">Lightclients could help to save gas</a>. However, I&apos;m neither too influentialin the space nor can I have canons full of VC fiat to further my ideas.So then what&apos;s left?</p><h2 id="following-pieters-advice">Following Pieter&apos;s advice</h2><p>It&apos;s always a good idea to trust the legacy knowledge of a deadperson, right? Well, let&apos;s say, at least they won&apos;t have much of achance of turning out to be an idiot on Twitter later simply because,you know, they&apos;re dead and hence can&apos;t tweet.</p><p>But putting that tangentant/weird thought aside for a second, here&apos;sone of Pieter Hintjens&apos; great ideas: &quot;<strong>Don&apos;t have a technicalvision. Solve problems!</strong>&quot; [3]. OK, so gas prices are too damnhigh. What can we do about it?</p><p>Well, hear me out, <strong>how about... we make transactions use lessgas!</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/images/unwantedadvice.png"></p><p>And how do we make transactions use less gas? We do so by reducingthe usage of expensive <a href="https://ethervm.io/">EVM opcodes</a> inour blockchain scripts. Or by sending less transactions. Hence, the restof this post summarizes my research into how to use less gas.</p><h2 id="a-problem-wasteful-approve-transactions">A Problem: Wasteful<code>approve</code> Transactions</h2><p>On April 18, 2021, Ethereum processed 1,396,766 transactions, ofwhich 915,104 (65,5%) were ERC-20 token transfers [1, 2]. Having anERC-20 contract interact with another contract (e.g., a DEX) means thatthere will be an <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-allowance-address-address-"><code>allowance(address owner, address spender)</code></a>transaction first <em>before</em> transferring any value from A toB.</p><p>But why is that? See, conceptually, an ERC-20 token is a script thatruns as a singleton on Ethereum. It&apos;s akin to an ordinary object (as in&quot;Object-oriented programming,&quot; short &quot;OOP&quot;) but technically called a&quot;contract&quot; (as in &quot;smart contract&quot;). A developer constructs it upondeployment to chain. Other contracts like automated market makers are,too, built like singletons.</p><p>Further, this means that a contract can own state and make itselectively accessible. It&apos;s similar to how classes work in, e.g.,JavaScript. There&apos;s a state variable, and we must access it throughgetters and setters.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">Store</span> {</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="title function_">constructor</span>(<span class="params">a</span>) {</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">a</span> = a;</span><br><span class="line">  }</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">set</span> <span class="title function_">a</span>(<span class="params">value</span>) {</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">a</span> = value;</span><br><span class="line">  }</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">get</span> <span class="title function_">a</span>() {</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="variable language_">this</span>.<span class="property">a</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  }</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Hence, for an object <code>store,</code> that is an instance of theclass <code>Store</code>, we wouldn&apos;t be able to directly access<code>this.a</code>. Instead, we can only set it using its settermethod. Hence, we have no control over <code>this.a</code> from theoutside.</p><p>EVM languages like Solidity and their token contracts (e.g. ERC-20)use this exact logic to transfer tokens between parties. Do you want tosend one from A to B? Sure, then to move your token, call the contract&apos;ssetter function <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-Transfer-address-address-uint256-"><code>transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)</code></a>to edit the underlying mapping between addresses the number of tokensthey own.</p><p>Now, the problem of having to call the <code>allowance</code>function before making a <code>transfer</code> arises when interactingwith a token through a third-party contract.</p><p>A typical use case is to swap two tokens on a decentralized exchange.As it has to send back the counter pair of your swap (e.g., you tradeWETH for USDC), it&apos;ll have to guarantee to receive your WETH when itssending out USDC in return.</p><p>Hence, when a user calls a DEX&apos;s swap function, the DEX will contactthe user&apos;s token contract to <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-"><code>transferFrom(address user, address DEX, uint256 amount)</code></a>to ingest the user&apos;s WETH and then transfer its USDC to the user.</p><p>As all of this happens in a single and atomic transaction, that willfail if any of its sub-operations fail, a DEX contract can ensure thesafety of swapping of two tokens. However, since the swap contract hasno authority over setting another user&apos;s token balance by, e.g., calling<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-"><code>transferFrom(address user, address DEX, uint256 amount)</code></a>,an upfront <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-approve-address-uint256-"><code>approve(address DEX, uint256 amount)</code></a>transaction is required.</p><p>That&apos;s why you have to do two transactions when you&apos;re starting outtrading on, e.g. Uniswap.</p><h2 id="quantifying-wasteful">Quantifying &quot;wasteful&quot;</h2><p>Still, you may say that an <code>approve</code> transaction may onlyhave to be sent once for a given token and a third-party contract. Andthat&apos;s an acceptable hypothesis. But let&apos;s look into how wasteful thatis.</p><p>We can do so using the logs of Ethereum called &quot;events.&quot; To query forthem, we take an event&apos;s function signature and hash it using <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html">Keccak-256</a>.</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">keccak256(&quot;Approval(address,address,uint256)&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&gt; 8c5be1e5ebec7d5bd14f71427d1e84f3dd0314c0f7b2291e5b200ac8c7c3b925</span><br><span class="line">keccak256(&quot;Transfer(address,address,uint256)&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&gt; ddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Using <a href="https://duneanalytics.com/queries/35211">DuneAnalytics&apos; brilliant API</a>, we can then query all of last week&apos;s logsin Ethereum (from block <a href="https://etherscan.io/block/12230342">12230342</a>) to find howmany <code>Approval</code> and <code>Transfer</code> events there are.Comparing <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-Approval-address-address-uint256-"><code>Approval(address,address,uint256)</code></a>and <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-Transfer-address-address-uint256-"><code>Transfer(address,address,uint256)</code></a>events there were.

Assuming thatthe goal of every <code>Approval</code> event is a future<code>transfer</code> transaction, then 9,4% of <code>transfer</code>sstill require an upfront on-chain <code>approve</code> transactiontoday. Put differently: Approving transactions before a transfer is apotentially wasteful practice that we can optimize to save the Ethereumnetwork roughly 10% of transaction fees.</p><h2 id="gas-saving-improvement-proposals">Gas-Saving ImprovementProposals</h2><p>Indeed there are a few canonicalized ways to avoid upfront<code>approve</code> transactions. Using <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612">ERC-2612</a>, anadditional <code>permit</code> function allows a user to sign and relayan approval message offline.

    <updated>2021-04-18T15:01:12.000Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My good friend and collaborator <a href="https://www.granzotto.net/">Alberto Granzotto</a> recently startedhelping to get people vaccinated at home in the Italian Regione delVeneto. He has helped deliver 16 shots, with 173 sleeves already beingrolled up and ready for vaccination.</p><p>Since my move to Berlin in 2015, Alberto and I have beencollaborating on projects. But with <a href="https://github.com/vrde/serenissimo">Serenissimo</a>, a Telegrambot that books COVID-19 vaccine appointments automatically, Alberto ison a personal mission.</p><p><strong>T: I&apos;ve heard you&apos;re helping get people vaccinated now. Howcome?</strong></p><p>A: I wanted to get my mom vaccinated. She&apos;s 74 and had becomefrustrated with trying to book a vaccination appointment online. So Idecided to help her.</p><p><strong>T: What was the problem?</strong></p><p>A: To get vaccinated against COVID-19, she had to visit a websiteprovided by the Regione del Veneto and book an appointment first. Theprocess is as follows:</p><ol type="1"><li>She goes to the official website <a href="https://vaccinicovid.regione.veneto.it">https://vaccinicovid.regione.veneto.it</a>to find the public health office where she&apos;s registered. Then;</li><li>she enters her data.</li><li>If there is an available spot, she can reserve it and getvaccinated.</li><li>If there is none, she has to go back to step number one.</li></ol><p>To receive her vaccine, my mom started constantly checking thewebsite but ended up getting frustrated by having to enter herinformation over and over again.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/regionevenetoit.png" alt="A screenshot of Regione del Veneto&apos;s vaccination booking website."></p><p><strong>T: So what did you do?</strong></p><p>A: I asked myself how I could help to improve the situation. Ithought: Why not reverse the communication structure? Instead ofconstantly having to check the website, why not have a computer do thelaborious work?</p><p><strong>T: Great idea. So instead of asking everybody to poll thewebsite repeatedly, your bot inform subscribers when a spot isavailable?</strong></p><p>A: Correct. But do note that the vaccine situation in Veneto iscomplex. It&apos;s not &quot;first come, first served&quot;. There are differentcohorts and right now only people over 80 or with pre-existing healthconditions are eligible.</p><p><strong>T: Is that why you ended up building a Telegrambot?</strong></p><p>A. When I heard from friends that their elderly parents werestruggling too, I saw a way to help. My idea is to smooth the UX to makebooking appointments more accessible. I also released the bot&apos;s sourcecode on <a href="https://github.com/vrde/serenissimo">GitHub</a> as acommitment towards transparency.</p><p><strong>T: How&apos;s is going so far?</strong></p><p>A: As of today, I&apos;ve managed to get 16 people vaccinated! Then thereare 173 eligible people signed up with Serenissimo who are waiting for avaccine and 1218 people who want a vaccination but are currently noteligible.</p><p><strong>T: Wow! And is your bot handling personal data?</strong></p><p>A: Yes. To get an appointment on the official website, users mustprovide their &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Italian_fiscal_code&amp;oldid=1006804529">codicefiscale</a>,&quot; the Italian tax code. Anyone can calculate that code usingtheir first and last name, date of birth, and city of birth. The codeends up being a sequence of letters and numbers. It&apos;s personallyidentifiable information (short: &quot;PII&quot;), but not personal healthinformation (short: &quot;PHI&quot;). I&apos;d say it&apos;s your unique ID for the Italiangovernment. It&apos;s private, but not a secret.</p><p><em>Note from the editor: You can find websites that let youcalculate it yourself. See below.</em></p><p><img src="/assets/images/codicefiscale.png" alt="A screenshot of Tim&apos;s hypothetical codice fiscale."></p><p><strong>T: Interesting. I think we have something similar in Germany.It&apos;s called a &quot;Sozialversicherungsnummer.&quot; And in the US, I guess it&apos;scalled the &quot;Social Security Number.&quot; You built your bot in Telegram; howdo you make sure your users&apos; PII is protected?</strong></p><p>A: I have a privacy policy. If a user removes themselves from theservice, I make sure to delete their data. I&apos;ve looked into <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#10-deleting-data">Telegram&apos;s PrivacyPolicy</a>, and they, too, are deleting all data.</p><p><strong>T: Could your bot also work by sending SMS?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, I&apos;m currently refactoring it such that it&apos;s an option in thefuture.</p><p><strong>T: What do you think is more important, protecting personallyidentifiable information or protecting a person&apos;s health?</strong></p><p>A: That&apos;s a good question; I think it&apos;s a gradient. For example, the&quot;codice fiscale&quot; is personal, but you cannot do much with it alone. Theimportant thing is to have a policy to delete the data once you don&apos;tneed it anymore.</p><p><strong>T: Fair! Where&apos;s the source code?</strong></p><p>A: It&apos;s open-source on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/vrde/serenissimo">vrde/serenissimo</a>.</p><p><strong>T: Great! I&apos;ll take a look. Thanks for answering all myquestions. I wish you the best of success in helping to get more peoplevaccinated!</strong></p><p>A: You&apos;re welcome. If you&apos;re in Veneto and need an appointment for aCOVID shot, check out <a href="https://t.me/serenissimo_bot">t.me/serenissimo_bot</a>.</p><hr><p>If you liked this interview, please consider subscribing to mynewsletter below.

    <title>How To Use Emscripten &amp; WASM in Web Apps</title>
    <link href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/02/25/emscripten-wasm/"/>

    <updated>2021-02-25T10:18:30.000Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, I published a post about <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">how I built WASMSYNTH</a>. As I learned a lot during the process, the post ended upbecoming huge. I even ended up putting a whole section in the post&apos;sappendix.</p><p>Then yesterday, a friend of mine asked me about my opinion onemscripten, the tool I had used to build <a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth">WASM SYNTH</a>.Coincidentally, I ended up referring him to the WASM SYNTH post&apos;s <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/#appendix">appendix</a>,where I had described my build pipeline in detail.</p><p>Today, it made me realize that I could publish that appendix as anindividual post. And so that what I ended up doing. In the followingsections, you&apos;ll learn about the build process that I&apos;m using in theWASM SYNTH project.</p><p>&quot;How do I integrate WebAssembly into my regular web app build withoutbloating it too much?&quot; I wondered when I first started working withWebAssembly. To put things into perspective: I had just recentlyswitched from Webpack to rollup.js as I was sick of spending hourssetting up Webpack with its ten thousand magic configurationoptions.</p><p>To my surprise, however, neither framework has reasonable defaultsfor handling WebAssembly yet. Notably, when we generated the WebAssemblyoutputs using emscripten and they <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/04/loading-wasm">grewbigger than 4KB</a>. But there were other problems too:</p><ul><li>rollup.js bundles all source file into a single JavaScriptfile.</li><li>Booting the app, also means booting react.js, which itself starts acontinuous process that we&apos;ll somehow have to take into account.</li><li>emscripten generates a <code>.wasm</code> and a <code>.js</code>file. The <code>.wasm</code> file contains all C++ source code as wellas WebAssembly instructions. The <code>.js</code> file acts as the gluebetween WebAssembly and JavaScript.<ul><li>In some cases, there&apos;s this 4KB size limit on loading<code>.wasm</code> files</li><li>The emscripten <code>.js</code> glue code is super useful. I canrecommend including it into your code deliverable.</li></ul></li><li>The <code>AudioWorklet</code> is supposed to be included into thepage by using <code>new AudioContext().addModule(&lt;path&gt;)</code><ul><li>It has a separate global scope. But emscripten&apos;s glue code relies onthe global scope too (<code>Module</code> object)</li></ul></li><li>Rollup.js doesn&apos;t have good defaults or plugins for bundlingemscripten-generated <code>.wasm</code> code.</li></ul><p>In the end, this led me to build a custom pipeline to bundleemscripten builds every time my source changed. But before I explainhow, let&apos;s take a step back to understand how emscripten&apos;s compilationworks.</p><p>On installation, emscripten exports a command-line utility called<code>emcc</code> into the shell. To demonstrate its capabilities, let&apos;stry compiling the <code>Hello World</code> example from the beginning ofthe post:</p><figure class="highlight c++"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="keyword">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="keyword">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;emscripten/bind.h&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> <span class="keyword">namespace</span> emscripten;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">std::string <span class="title">hello</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>{</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;hello world&quot;</span>;</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> Using embind, we can define `hello`&apos;s external name</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS</span>(my_module) {</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">function</span>(<span class="string">&quot;hello&quot;</span>, &amp;hello);</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To make it executable by a browser, we&apos;ll use <code>emcc</code> tocompile it to a <code>.wasm</code> and a <code>.js</code> file.</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ emcc main.cc --<span class="built_in">bind</span> -WASM=1 -o main.js</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><code>emcc</code> here simply compiles all functions contained in<code>main.cc</code> into a <code>main.wasm</code> file. Besides, italso generates this glue code (<code>main.js</code>) using <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html">Embind</a>.It allows us to invoke functions, initially written in C++, directlyfrom within JavaScript as if they were just regular classes. So to makeemscripten&apos;s outputs work correctly, we&apos;ll have to include the<code>.js</code> into the page. On the initialization of the page,emscripten&apos;s clue code is loading the <code>.wasm</code> fileasynchronously. Through some trick, the browser skips the 4KB file sizelimit, and all our C++ classes are now available as native JSclasses:</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">html</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">body</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">&quot;wasm/main.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="language-javascript"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">      <span class="title class_">Module</span>.<span class="property">onRuntimeInitialized</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>) {</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">        <span class="variable language_">console</span>.<span class="title function_">log</span>(<span class="title class_">Module</span>.<span class="title function_">hello</span>());</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">      }</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">    </span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">body</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">html</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So far, so good. But, as I&apos;ve mentioned previously, one of theproblems now is that the <code>AudioWorklet</code>, being spawned in aseparate thread with a separate global scope, won&apos;t be aware ofemscripten&apos;s <code>window.Module</code>. So how do we export code fromwithin a Worklet?</p><p>After spending quite some time researching that question, Idiscovered that the Google Chrome Labs team <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/master/audio-worklet/design-pattern/wasm/index.html">recommends</a>transpiling all JavaScript source into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">nativemodules</a> and then simply use ES6&apos;s <code>import from</code> syntax.Well, it turns out the JS modules syntax <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">isn&apos;twidely supported yet</a>, particularly not in <code>Workers</code>, letalone <code>Worklets</code>...</p><p><img src="/assets/images/import-support.png"></p><p>But luckily, after banging my head another few days against JSmodules and other fancy new front end frameworks, I found a surprisinglysimple trick.</p><p>I reduce emscripten&apos;s outputs to a single <code>.js</code> file thatcontains the <code>.wasm</code> as base64 string using it&apos;s<code>-s SINGLE_FILE=1</code> option. As we need emscripten&apos;s<code>.js</code> file to define <code>window.Module</code> in the<code>AudioWorklet</code>&apos;s global scope, I then simply append theemscripten JavaScript file with the <code>AudioWorklet</code>&apos;JavaScript file to make them configure the same global scope. Thatallows me to execute WebAssembly from within a Worklet without using thepoorly supported <code>import from</code> syntax.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ethereum isn&apos;t fun anymore. There I said it.</strong> Andalthough, the last time I developed an app using it has been more than ayear ago, I stand by my word. <strong>Developing dapps on Ethereum hasbecome annoying</strong>. Here&apos;s why:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/pedro.gif"></p><h2 id="i-used-ethereum-before-it-was-cool.">I used Ethereum before itwas cool.</h2><p>I know; it&apos;s such a hipster statement. But it&apos;s true. Ethereum hasstopped being edgy. It has transitioned out of its niche to build aworld computer. Its community has become huge, and I stopped knowingmost faces. Where there was a feeling of revolution and new beginnings,now there are people in suits talking corporate. Within just a fewyears, it went from <a href="https://github.com/DaddyDeFi/DaiDaddy">DAIdaddys</a> and only <a href="https://www.molochdao.com/">half-ironicsatanist cults</a> to lending, insurance, and trade protocols.</p><p>&quot;What&apos;s Ethereum&apos;s killer app?&quot; we asked ourselves not long ago. Nowwe know. It&apos;s the world&apos;s best publicly-accessible settlement platformfor financial transactions. In a way, that&apos;s exciting. The markets thinkso too. But for anyone else that worked with Ethereum but outside offinancial applications, it&apos;s somewhat of a letdown.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/homer.gif"></p><h2 id="how-do-you-do-fellow-ethereans">How do you do, fellowEthereans?</h2><p>I think it must have been around the time of the last big cryptobubble when Monero enthusiasts called for &quot;Making Monero cheapagain.&quot;</p><p>Monero, being the anonymous digital currency that had indeed justlegit use cases apart from the occasional rumors that entangled it indrug trafficking, had suddenly become too expensive for everyday use.Realizing the glaring threat of becoming too valuable, its coredevelopers went on to fix the problem by campaigning at CoinDesk&apos;syearly industry gathering Consensus.</p><p>They announced the &quot;Monero Enterprise Alliance.&quot; An inside joke,supposed to piss off other projects that had started to take themselvestoo seriously. Being slightly confused that day myself, I now can&apos;trecall if the effort had ever been successful. But in any case, I can&apos;trecommend buying Monero. It&apos;s useless.</p><h2 id="gas-prices-are-too-damn-high">Gas prices are too damn high!</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/deepfried_high_rents.jpg"></p><p>There was a phase in my short career as an Ethereum developer where Ilooked at Etherscan&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified">Verified Contracts</a>&quot;page all day long to find vulnerabilities in newly uploaded contracts.&quot;My name&apos;s Tim and I&apos;m an etherholic!&quot;</p><p>It was addictive. I ended up calling a few of those contracts,failing to cause any havoc, sadly. But it was so much fun! Back whentransaction fees were still affordable on Ethereum, building projectswas great. We started up Ganache and our favorite text editor (vim). Theonly choice we had was Solidity. And off we went.</p><p>Now, building Ethereum applications has become painful. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">web3 is a stupididea</a>. Layer 2 isn&apos;t ready. Neither is Eth 2.0. And there are still<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2019/02/28/poa/">many reasons to NOTship to a Proof of Authority network</a>. Finally, gas prices are toodamn high!</p><p>How do we move on from here?</p><h2 id="i-need-a-hero.">I need a hero.</h2><p><strong>I need a hero, and by that, I mean that I need a usablemethodology for building scaleable decentralized apps.</strong> Yes,you&apos;ve heard that right. We don&apos;t need more &quot;Ethereum killers&quot; that cando 10x more tx/s than Ethereum. Those are useless.</p><p>Instead, we need an approach for the average Joe developer to createtheir idea within the Ethereum ecosystem without the need for hardcoreunproven technologies. I know, you Vitalik will say: &quot;Oh, it&apos;s not aproblem, we can has &apos;<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html">GarbledCircuits</a>&apos; and zkrollups.&quot; But I&apos;m telling you that no sane Joe willtouch that shit without a serious cryptographic specialist by theirside.</p><p>We want what we stayed for initially: Good ol smart contracts.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&apos;s now roughly seven or eight years that I&apos;m building dynamic frontends for the web. From <a href="https://www.ascribe.io/">digital artwallets</a> to games (<a href="https://ipfs.leapdao.org/blog/Planet-A-ccc-ethberlin-recap/">1</a>,<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/videogame">2</a>) and <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/wasm-synth">synthesizers</a>, I&apos;ve seenit all. And since my process of creation has dramatically changed overthe years, today, I&apos;d like to share how I&apos;m developing web apps in2021.</p><h2 id="i-avoid-build-processes.">I avoid build processes.</h2><p>I still remember the debates with colleagues about using <a href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a> a few years ago. Within the frontend development world, transpiling had just become a thing, so we endedup babelifying our builds to use ES6. Our argument back then was thatone day, we would be able to push our application&apos;s directory structureon a web server and since all browsers would then support the augmentedES6 features, our app would just work! Without a build process. WOW!That must have been around 2015. When I look at the source code of theseold applications now, our technical visions didn&apos;t end up becomingreality.</p><p>Now, I try to keep my build process to a minimum. When I need towrite a demo app, I particularly like using <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone#script-tags"><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/babel&quot;&gt;</code></a>.I love <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started/#no-build-tools-route">preact&apos;s&quot;no build tools route.&quot;</a> too. When I have to set up an actual app, Iavoid <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> and <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup</a>. I mainly get frustrated aboutthe myriad ways of configuring them. Some minor thing always ends upbeing broken, which leads to hours of debugging foreign code. And that&apos;sfrustrating. Using preact&apos;s no build route, finally something like theabove is possible:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&lt;script type=<span class="string">&quot;module&quot;</span>&gt;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> You literally don&apos;t need a build process with preact.</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">import</span> { h, <span class="title class_">Component</span>, render } <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">&apos;https://unpkg.com/preact?module&apos;</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">const</span> app = <span class="title function_">h</span>(<span class="string">&apos;h1&apos;</span>, <span class="literal">null</span>, <span class="string">&apos;Hello World!&apos;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="title function_">render</span>(app, <span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="property">body</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&lt;/script&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>When having to use a build tool, I gravitate towards <a href="https://parceljs.org/">parcel</a> or <a href="https://github.com/developit/microbundle">microbundle</a> as theycome preconfigured. And in particular, parcel is excellent, as it&apos;smerely using an HTML file as its entry point. To me, that&apos;s promising asit assumes a proper directory structure and properly connected filessuch that maybe one day I can push my app to the web without that buildstep.</p><h2 id="i-avoid-transpiling.">I avoid transpiling.</h2><p>For the same reasons as pointed out above, I also try to avoidtranspiling. It&apos;s not because I don&apos;t like ESNext features, but morebecause I want to minimize the risk of getting stuck with thetranspiler. Hence, I try to avoid using babel. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/">I also don&apos;t useTypescript</a>. To me, JavaScript is productive enough. Additionally,for <a href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>-style projects, notranspilers mean I stopped using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>. Instead, Ifound an excellent library called <a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> that uses JavaScript&apos;stemplate strings. It has a similar syntax to JSX, but it&apos;s not breakingECMAScript standards and hence needs no transpliation.</p><h2 id="i-avoid-the-new-and-shiny.">I avoid the <em>new</em> and<em>shiny</em>.</h2><p>I even avoid changing the way I work if I don&apos;t feel comfortable orinclined. For example, I never switched to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">react hooks</a>. The <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">lifecyclemethods</a> that I initially know from iOS Objective-C programming are -in my opinion - a beautiful metaphor for writing front end components.And neither did I have any issues with my sites&apos; performance. I wouldmake the switch if I started to have problems. But I don&apos;t. The samegoes for up and coming frameworks. Angular V2? <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>? Cool, but why relearn a frameworkwhen I&apos;m already productive with the one I use?</p><h2 id="i-test-everything.">I test EvErYtHiNg.</h2><p>When I started front-end development, testing was complicated. Only afew front end developer colleagues tested their apps properly. I endedup doing a lot of testing by hand. It was frustrating and unproductive.But testing front ends has improved dramatically over the years. Notonly have the tools been significantly enhanced.</p><p>We, as front-end developers, have now also figured out how tocorrectly write front end tests. Finally, we&apos;re able to distinguishbetween functional code and presentational code. For functional code, wenow write unit tests. For presentational code, we use snapshot-basedtesting and integration tests. I&apos;m pleased about tools like <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a> that is great for integrationtests. I also like <a href="https://github.com/avajs/ava/">ava</a> forunit tests.</p><h2 id="i-optimize-for-performance-and-quality.">I optimize forperformance and quality.</h2><p>I used to be eager about building extensively functional software:the more features, the better. I&apos;m not anymore. Instead, I try todevelop software that works well for my users. I strive for quality. SoI try to measure my build&apos;s size. I take proper care about delivering myapplication, meaning I turn on compression and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">caching</a>.I care about optimizing my static assets like pictures. And I like tocheck my apps by using tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=de">PageSpeedInsights</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.</p><h2 id="i-use-my-own-work">I use my own work</h2><p>From experience, I learned that I hardly ever get stuck on aalgorithmic problem. On the contrary, I get motivated to learn somethingnew and excel in the process. However, I caught my self often spendingmany hours on debugging other people&apos;s code. Mainly when it&apos;sthird-party libraries that I included via npm. Once, I thought thatusing npm packages was a JavaScript developer&apos;s superpower. Now, I knowthat it can also be their curse.</p><p>Instead of collecting heaps of third-party code, I now preferfollowing <a href="http://hintjens.com/blog:96">Peter Hintjens&apos;principles for writing good code</a>. I &quot;use my own work.&quot; Meaning, Idare to write seemingly complex code myself. I still won&apos;t roll my owncrypto or write a date library, but I dare to implement parts of aprotocol or build an algorithm. It&apos;s not to say that I ditch every npmpackage and go npm-keto-diet. No, instead, I take a more mindfulapproach towards dependencies and only include them when I truly needthem.</p><p>I try to do that by leaving my technical vision at the doorstep of myoffice, so that I can now focus on solving the problems at hand. I tryto stop worrying about eventualities far in the future as I view that asspeculation. In cases I have past experiences, I use it to form mydecision. For unchartered teritory, I move carefully, step by step.</p><h2 id="i-use-open-source-to-my-advantage.">I use open source to myadvantage.</h2><p>I&apos;m building websites since I&apos;m a teenager. And had I open-sourcedand maintained a few pieces of code that I need frequently, I&apos;d be moreproductive now. Unfortunately, I was short-sighted. Surprisingly, Ididn&apos;t think about still using JavaScript at 29 years of age &#x1F602;</p><p>I stopped framing open source mainly around certain virtues like freespeech, fairness or certain politics. They&apos;re still important virtuesfor me, but I learned that I could use open source also for building apersonal toolset.</p><p>Extracting a library from a codebase allows me to think about it froma user&apos;s perspective. It means I&apos;m able to think about a piece of code&apos;sinterfaces emphatically. Additionally, there&apos;s positive peer pressure.I&apos;m not going to release shit to the world. When my project is public,it&apos;s going to have a proper README and some docs. And it&apos;s going to betested. Since everybody can see it, I might as well create something Ican be proud of.</p><p>Hence, contributing to open source, for me, is about buildinghigh-quality software. Being anxious about not being able to monetizethis particular piece of code has become less of a concern. <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresohrus</a> inspired me totreat open source packages like my personal toolbox.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>And that&apos;s my incomplete list of principles. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s morethan just these. Anyway, I still find some of these points quitecontroversial. I&apos;m sure they won&apos;t work for everyone as all our contextsdiffer. But working solo as a freelancer, I&apos;ve found that theseprinciples contribute to me being content about what I&apos;m doing. Hence, Iwas eager to share them.</p><p>I&apos;m curious to hear other&apos;s thoughts and see if they&apos;ve taken similarpaths. Please reach out! Also, don&apos;t forget to subscribe to mynewsletter!</p>]]></content>

Moreimportantly, though, this means that they can take the stage on the <a href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a>&apos;sassembly and jam away to a virtually present audience.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/wasm-stream.png" alt="Social Dist0rtion Protocol&apos;s dance floor in the rc3.world"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Social Dist0rtion Protocol&apos;s dance floorin the rc3.world</figcaption></figure><p>So how did I build it?</p><h2 id="a-first-little-demo">A First Little Demo</h2><p><a href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a> is aproject that I built deliberately to showcase the power of the web. Atthe beginning of the year, I wrote <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">a blog post</a>outlining its technical details. It&apos;s using the<code>AudioWorklet</code> and some WebAssembly-transpiled code to renderaudio in real-time in the user&apos;s browser.</p><p>Now, workadventure, the software ccc uses to run their rc3.world, isalso built on the web and allows embedding audio streams. So I thought,why not take the audio generated in wasm-synth and stream it to everyonein the rc3 world.</p><p>In a way, it sounds like not that big of a deal to build an audiostreaming client within a website. But remember that a browser&apos;snetworking ability is limited. While we&apos;ve come a long way from the<code>XMLRequest</code> API to <code>fetch</code>,<code>WebSocket</code> and <code>WebRTC</code>, these concepts onlyallow talking upstream if their authors deliberately built theirupstream application for supporting them.</p><p>Naive as I Am, I started by deploying <a href="https://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> to a small Hetzner instance. Iconfigured an authorized mount point that allows a streamer to connectusing client software. Then I looked for a way to stream audio directlyto icecast from a browser. And found... nothing.</p><p>Well, I did find something. It&apos;s called <a href="https://webcast.github.io/">webcast</a>, and it&apos;s a <a href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">WebSocket-basedsubprotocol</a> that allows sending binary audio data between a clientand a server. In their <a href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js#server">README.md</a>, theauthors also mention webcast&apos;s compatibility with <a href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/">liquidsoap</a>, a DSL for audiostream processing.</p><p>So my first attempt at plugging these things together involvedencoding the <code>Float32Array</code> data from the<code>AudioWorklet</code> into an mp3 stream using <a href="https://github.com/toots/shine/">libshine</a> (that has a wasmJavaScript package) and then sending it to a <a href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/harbor.html">liquidsoap&quot;harbor&quot;</a> via webcast. Liqidsoap would then convert the mp3 stream toogg-vorbis, make it stereo, and forward it to the icecast server.</p><p>And, to my surprise, it worked. When I hit some keys on thewasm-synth, they got encoded and sent to the audio stream. With a bit ofdelay, I heard what I had just played. Cool!</p><p>Anyways, with my small little demo, I was galvanized and motivatedenough to spend more time building something that would work for thecongress.</p><h2 id="the-wasm-stream-architecture">The WASM-STREAM Architecture</h2><p>Ultimately, liquidsoap was not well-suited for my purpose. I alsoquickly realized that all I had to do was build a proxy between the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ePirat/adc3b8ba00d85b7e3870">icecastprotocol</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">webcastprotocol</a>. And that&apos;s what I ended up building. A small <a href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">JavaScriptapplication</a> implementing two protocols. It listens for incomingWebSocket connections and calls icecast with a loooooonng PUT request toestablish a stream.</p><p>WASM-STREAM itself doesn&apos;t do any encoding. It can, however, route an<code>audio/ogg</code> or an <code>audio/mpeg</code> stream from webcastto icecast. The encoding from WAV to mp3 takes place on the user&apos;sdevice already when the play the synthesizer.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-wasm-stream">How To Use WASM-STREAM</h2><p>Whether you have a ticket to rc3 or not, you can tune into the streamat <a href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream">https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream</a>.It&apos;s an mp3-encoded stream, meaning it won&apos;t work in all browsersequally (Firefox works natively; Chrome et al. only support ogg/vorbisnatively). If it doesn&apos;t, try a desktop application like iTunes orVLC.</p><p>The stream is continuously online. But if you don&apos;t hear anythingthen that&apos;s because nobody is currently playing the <a href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">WASM-SYNTH</a>.</p><p>Finally, you&apos;re able to &quot;dance&quot; on the Social Dist0rtion Protocol&apos;sassembly dance floor. The rc3 orga was nice enough to allow us streamingaudio on our map. <a href="https://rc3.world/rc3/room/93840a8f-88f7-4f11-bb61-68800c4d4962/">Clickhere</a> to visit us directly on the rc3.world map.</p>]]></content>

Tough decision! But that&apos;s precisely the type of situation <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> users face in itsnewly-launched decentralized <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">data set market</a> [3].</p><p>I&apos;ll spare you most of the details of how it all works and say this:2020&apos;s most transforming technology has been <strong>on-chainmarkets</strong>. In particular, the implementation that <a href="https://uniswap.org/">uniswap.org</a> is using called<strong>automated market makers</strong>.</p><p>Simply put, they work by incentivizing users to <em>pool</em> a pairof assets at a ratio they deem as the assets&apos; current prices. Theseusers, I herein call them <strong>liquidity providers</strong>, e.g.,pool 1 ETH and 540 USDC, so that when a buyer of either asset comesalong, they can immediately trade 1 ETH for 540 USDC or 540 USDC for 1ETH. This principle works fantastically at scale, as the poolincentivizes liquidity-providing by charging buyers and sellers a smallfee, which is distributed by the pool to each liquidity provider,respectively [1].</p><p><img src="/assets/images/marketmakers.png" style="background-color: white;border: 5px solid black; border-radius: 5px;"></p><p>This model has been so successful that there&apos;ve been days wheredecentralized trading on Uniswap outperformed volumes on Coinbase!Which, of course, has lots of implications on the cryptocurrency space.I think it&apos;s no overstatement to say that automated market makers may be<strong>the killer app for crypto</strong>.</p><div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1300034164830408704"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>But there&apos;s one implication I&apos;ve been particularly keen on exploring:all <strong>the openly-accessible data produced by on-chainmarkets</strong>. See, if you ever tried building a trading bot, you&apos;llhave noticed the terrible resolution publicly-available market data has.You might have also noticed that it&apos;s quite difficult even to find dataat all. It&apos;s not by accident. <strong>Trading data isvaluable</strong>.</p><h2 id="rating-a-data-set-by-its-markets-performance">Rating a Data Setby its Market&apos;s Performance</h2><p>Remember when I asked you at the beginning of this article about<strong>buying a data set from a random stranger on theinternet?</strong> Well, it turns out that Ocean Protocol is now bettingon the same technology that made Uniswap successful. They allow users topublish a data set, along with a fungible <strong>data token</strong>and an integrated <strong>automated market maker</strong>. Meaning, youcan now buy access to a data set by purchasing tokens. These tokens getpriced by liquidity providers providing a ratio of OCEAN Tokens to<em>data tokens</em>.</p><p>However, just because data sets are now available for sale on themarket, doesn&apos;t mean you know they&apos;re valuable! After all, if ebay.comdidn&apos;t have a rating system for sellers, how would you know which sellerto trust?</p><p>On ebay.com, you know which seller to trust because you can see howmany articles they&apos;ve sold and what each buyer&apos;s experience was. It&apos;s asimple identity-based rating system.</p><p>But within the anarchistic world of cryptocurrencies, there are noworking identity-based rating systems! Instead, the space is filled with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account">sockpuppets</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybils</a>.<strong>Then, without buying a data set first, how are we supposed toknow if a data set is valuable or an outright scam?</strong></p><h2 id="introducing-rugpullindex.com">Introducing rugpullindex.com</h2><p>That&apos;s where <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>comes into play. <strong>We crawl all of Ocean Protocol&apos;s data tokenpools daily</strong> and rate each market&apos;s liquidity providerdistribution by its equality using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Ginicoefficient</a>. While ranking markets based on their liquidity iscommon industry-practice, calculating a Gini score for each market&apos;sliquidity provider shares isn&apos;t. The idea behind this is that the moreliquidity providers with an equal share back an asset in the market, theless likely it is for a &quot;rug pull&quot; attack to happen (details <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/multi-repo-issue/issues/30#issuecomment-726132174">here</a>).By factoring in a pool&apos;s relative liquidity, it allows us to derive ascore <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">s</span></span></span></span> that is <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>100</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0 &lt; s &lt; 100</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68354em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;"></span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">&lt;</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.5782em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">s</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">&lt;</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">0</span></span></span></span>.</p><p>For users of <a href="https://rugpullindex.com">rugpullindex.com</a>,this <strong>yields a few attractive benefits</strong>:</p><ol type="1"><li>They can now choose to adjust their data set investments based onmarket data.</li><li>They can decide to invest in data sets relative to their performanceon to <em>increase their diversivication and hence lower their exposurerisk</em>.

As we just had released our browser-compatibleJavaScript driver, enthusiastically, I told the audience: &quot;... and so byusing our driver from within the browser, your app won&apos;t need a backendanymore&quot;!</p><p>That must have been around 2017 when I first discovered Metamask, andstarted drinking Ethereum&apos;s web3 cool-aid. Arguably, web3 quickly becamesomething extraordinary. All of a sudden, users could download a browserextension and directly interact with a public network. In a sense, itstill is extraordinary.</p><p>If you have an extension like Metamask installed in your browsertoday, you can visit sites on the web that allow you to do the craziestthings with your digital money. An excellent recent example of this areDeFi (short for &quot;Decentralized Finance&quot;) websites. They allow a user toengage in trading cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity, and peer topeer lending. With the click of a button and no mandatory signups,you&apos;re able to pool thousands of dollars. That is super cool andconfirms the viability of the web3 vision.</p><p>But actually, what is the web3 vision? It may be that there never wassuch a thing in the first place. All I know is that someone named alibrary &quot;web3.js&quot;. Developers use it to talk to remote or local Ethereumnodes when working in a browser environment (JavaScript).</p><p>On a web3-enabled website, when a user now clicks a button to, e.g.,pool ether in a smart contract, most calculations are supported by theweb3.js library that periodically talks to an Ethereum node. Ultimatelyweb3.js allows the user to send the transaction to the node to transferthe user&apos;s money.</p><p>Often, a key-management program, like Metamask, is running on theuser&apos;s browser. It allows the user to sign transactions with the samekey on different websites.</p><p>In a nutshell, that&apos;s web3. It&apos;s supposed to be a play on wordsregarding &quot;web 2.0&quot;. Web 2.0 is the upgrade of web standards that gaveus modern single-page applications and dynamic AJAX loading. And Web3?An advancement towards what exactly? Money websites?</p><p>Indeed, if you were capable of cleaning your mind of specificmemories, specifically, let&apos;s say you could do<code>grep -l web3 brain | xargs rm</code>. And then someone asked youhow you&apos;d envision a blockchain-based and smart-contract-enabled web3;you&apos;d likely describe an ecosystem vastly different to what it is today.You&apos;d think about peer-2-peer networks, light clients, and renewed webstandards. That&apos;s precisely not web3.</p><p>In today&apos;s experience it will instead be mostly shitty react websitesthat crash or stop working when you&apos;ve neglected to install Metamask (orother key-management plugins). Opening a web3 website&apos;s network console,you&apos;ll see that it&apos;s making an excessive amount of RPC request to anEthereum full node. Sorry, I meant to say Infura node, a hugely-popularcloud provider hosting Ethereum full nodes. That&apos;s kinda stupid.</p><p>And since Metamask allows developers to prompt the user for specificcontract calls, what&apos;s even more stupid, is that all your money may beat the risk of continually getting stolen with the accidential click ofa button. Either by someone hacking the website&apos;s server. Or by thewebsite provider becoming corrupt themselves. Or simply because awebsite pretends to do X when it does Y (stealing all your money).</p><p>But instead of continuing to rant, I&apos;d now like to now point out whatI think should change about web3:</p><ul><li>We should stop building key-management plugins and start thinkingabout a standardizable web API. We must stop training our users toinstall shitty browser plugins!</li><li>We need to make light clients work as soon as possible and becomeindependent from third-party services like thegraph and Infura.</li><li>We need to improve our client libraries (ethers.js and web3.js) bydramatically simplifying them and making them bug-free (god damnit!)!</li><li>We need to take advantage of some of the blockchain&apos;s fundamentalproperties. Most data is immutable so let&apos;s start caching things.</li></ul><p>And finally, I think we should stop focusing all of our attention onbumping the web&apos;s version number. Maybe we should reconsider writingmore backends. We should promote more work on permissionless networkslike Open Gas Station Network that allow developers to upgrade a user&apos;sexperience. And, we should start thinking of a machine network ofblockchains more often. In many ways, web3 was just a cool demo. Butlet&apos;s come up with something better. Just imagine what happens oncethere&apos;s a deeper integration of money into computer systems!</p><hr><h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2><ul><li><a href="/#writing">All posts</a></li><li>2021-08-22: <a href="/2021/08/22/intellectual-property-will-become-irrelevant/">IntellectualProperty Is Becoming Irrelevant</a></li><li>2021-02-22: <a href="/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">Ethereum isn&apos;t funanymore</a></li><li>2021-07-21: <a href="/2021/07/21/nfts-are-coming-for-instagram/">NFTs are coming forInstagram and other social media platforms</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <title>TypeScript is weakening the JavaScript ecosystem</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In recent months, I&apos;ve noticed a dramatic increase in TypeScriptpackages on GitHub. I usually come across them when checkingrepositories of the people I follow like. Or, when I&apos;m looking fordependencies to solve a problem in my projects. And the more TypeScriptpackages I&apos;m encountering, the more often I get reminded of this littleannoyance towards the project.</p><p>My context is that I&apos;ve not looked into TypeScript yet. That means Ihave no idea how it works. Unfortunately, this is now starting to becomekind of a problem when searching for dependencies. It does, when Ieither willingly or accidentally include a TypeScript package into myprojects. Mainly because my package-choosing criteria include:</p><ul><li>picking packages that I potentially can contribute to (e.g., alesser-known package that contains well-written code); or</li><li>picking packages that are well-maintained by a large community butmay include code that I&apos;d not be able to easily contribute to (e.g., apopular package using a C library internally)</li></ul><p>I&apos;ve put these criteria in place willingly to achieve a certainquality standard when building applications. Either because I can fixbugs myself quickly, or because I&apos;m able to rely on a strong communityto fix them. However, with TypeScript packages in npm, there&apos;s now thisopaque problem of not knowing the language or quickly telling apackage&apos;s language and its community size. Also, TypeScript could bejust another CoffeeScript.</p><p>So essentially, the problem is that TypeScript authors publish theirpackages on npm, the package manager for Node.js. And to me, that&apos;s whatis weakening the JavaScript ecosystem. Since its inception, andthroughout trends like Coffeescript, npm has mostly held the promise ofonly hosting JavaScript packages. However, this promise is<code>rejected()</code> (lol) by many authors publishing theirTypeScript-to-JavaScript transpiled packages.</p><p>Indeed, it makes sense considering that Microsoft markets TypeScriptas a &quot;superset of JavaScript&quot; and since it &quot;compiles&quot; to JavaScript, whynot publish packages to npm? But in terms of equality and identity,TypeScript is not JavaScript. After all, you&apos;d not consider C andObjective-C the same either, or would you? In both examples, thelanguages are subsets/supersets but were conceived with different goalsin mind to solve other problems.</p><p>Therefore, TypeScript authors should, in my opinion, do somethingalong the following lines:</p><ul><li>namespacing their TypeScript packages; or</li><li>build and publish their packages to their package manager.</li></ul><p>However, continuing to publish TypeScript packages to npm is, in myopinion weakening the JavaScript ecosystem as it&apos;s splitting itscommunity and polluting the npm namespace.</p><h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2><ul><li>For a short time, there was an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24344506">intenseconversation</a> on Hacker News. But for unknown reasons, my post gotmarked as <code>[flagged]</code>. I&apos;ve written an email to theoperators.</li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The week before the first of May, I drove home to visit the family.After all, we had planned to go skiing when the virus hit my region oforigin quite harshly. Additionally, my grandparents weren&apos;t doing allthat well, so there was no consensus in the family on what to dogenuinely.</p><p>I stayed in Berlin. At least half of my friends drove southwards totheir families. And then in the south, I have no idea what people did.But naively judging by the numbers, Berliner&apos;s (at least in March) wereless naughty and paid close attention to their central coordinator (theGerman government, the WHO?).</p><p>And then the second half of March and first of April were really justthe weirdest moments of my life. Suddenly, there was actual socialdistancing and not physical distancing. It seemed that not only I buteveryone was struggling one way or another. I felt mistrust building,especially since proper video calling simply didn&apos;t work well, but alsosince nobody was supposed to go out and have a healthy life. My naturalparanoia gave it the rest.</p><p>But I think the weirdest part in all of this story played the city ofBerlin. Why? Because it seemed that people genuinely didn&apos;t give a shitabout the virus, but at the same time, everything worked so smoothly. Imean, nothing had changed in the city. People went to parks, had theircoffee. Some even still went to work. Already in &quot;the outbreak&apos;s&quot; firstweek, lots of shops had completely turned around their money-makingprocedures. Instead of having to enter a cafe, now you had to scream&quot;due Cappuccini&quot; through a street-level window. The barista, a weirdlooking hipster guy, would then in safe proximity brew your drink whilesuddenly you were able to pay cashless.</p><p>Yes, you heard that right. You were able to pay cashless. In Berlin.But not only that. Additionally, the guy had set up a considerable areaof very spacious benches outside. That meant keeping a safe distancewhile slurping Cappuccini was quickly possible.</p><p>Elsewhere, this early model of successful adaption quickly spread. Mylocal baker soon had introduced spacious queues and even a pipelinesystem to handle customers. So while they had two entrances and exitsbefore the crisis, they suddenly had one deliberate entry and one door.Eventually, they went further by introducing a cashier person (handlingall the money) and a bread person (packing the bread).</p><p>The shop next to the baker did another cool thing. They gave a 25%discount on cashless payments. Not sure they still do it, but I found ita nice touch.</p><p>Many other things happened too. I could go on. However, eventually, Iwanted to see my family, and so I rented a car and drove down south (Iused to take the train). And I can tell you, it was great! Not havingseen my brother, mom, and dad since Christmas, lots of information hadto be replicated. Lots of stories hat to be synchronized. Tears,laughter, hope, despair. For sure, we had it all! And eventually, wephased.</p><p>In fact, there was one particular moment that really got me phased(or amazed?) very much. I guess I&apos;m telling the story on the about pageof this blog post too. Anyways, I&apos;ve been practicing playing the pianofor more than two years now. Initially, however, I had been inspired bymy brother&apos;s sick e-guitar skills. In a nutshell, the two of us had beencompeting on playing instruments for a while now. Mainly on the piano,when suddenly I realized he had brought his e-guitar this time.</p><p>We plugged it in on our parent&apos;s patio, and I hit a few notes. Then -he had found the old western guitar from my mom - he played a few notes.Suddenly the piano music theory lessons about harmony and melody startedkicking in, and I went into improvisation-mode trying to support and/orlead what the two of us were playing. It was a fantastic feeling! Trulya level-up in life. Jazz or multiplayer improvisation had alwaysfascinated me. It had fascinated me with a profound intolerance andfrustration of not being able to understand how it worked. But now,since all I had to do was either, hitting low notes when he was playinghigh notes, or high notes when he was playing low notes, it suddenlymade sense to me. And not only that. The next days, it also made methink quite a lot about eventual consistency in distributed systems.</p><p>You see. These days all we seem to want is central coordinators withgod views guiding us. We deliberately trust them with our lives andproperty. We do it because of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>.Or because our collective intuition tells us to throw our dearest valuesinto the flaming pit, faithfully-believing that from the nutritiousashes, a tiny new bud of hope will eventually appear.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what it was this time we threw. Some argue privacy,others say it was our freedom to freely travel the globe. In fact, Ithink that on a global level, consistency hasn&apos;t emerged yet. It may bethat it will not for many years or decades. After all, there&apos;s money tobe made with this asynchronicity.</p><p>Also, I don&apos;t know much about these things, and so probably I shouldstay within the realm of my domain to make arguments. And so let&apos;s getback to Jazz. Well, actually, let&apos;s get back to uhm Cloudcountry anddistributed systems.</p><p>A story that I found quite inspiring in all of this is the story ofthe creation of Lil Nas X&apos;s Old time road. Here&apos;s the video:</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sq6zmzE8y3U" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>To me, that video is incredible. It&apos;s incredible because it tells thestory of two entirely socially and physically separate musicianscollaborating. Even more so as they do it asynchronously, on an idea&apos;soutput that eventually requires total synchronicity (or strongconsistency). I mean, watch the video. The story has already been told.YoungKio and Lil Nax X jazzed across a massive pond of water. They wereable to simply create the mega-hit of 2019 (and a weird genre too).</p><p>I&apos;m fascinated as in my naive understanding of music, I alwaysthought that Jazz meant breaking the rules of social and physicaldistancing. I thought it meant getting together physically as bandwidthand latency of the internet didn&apos;t allow musical cooperation. I feltthat through live streaming, we&apos;d never be able to indeed composecollaboratively. But I was wrong. It&apos;s not better live streams ortelephony or central coordinators that we need for music to trulysucceed in times of SARS-CoV-2. What we need today is asynchronous Jazz,or as we computer scientists call it: <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> (and CRDTs), but for musicians! I&apos;dcall it an (.arc(hive)) or <code>.hive</code> :)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.1/dist/katex.min.css" integrity="sha384-dbVIfZGuN1Yq7/1Ocstc1lUEm+AT+/rCkibIcC/OmWo5f0EA48Vf8CytHzGrSwbQ" crossorigin="anonymous"><p>Just yesterday, I got my hands on a really wonderful graphic novelcalled <em>&quot;The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage&quot;</em>. It&apos;sabout the invention of the first computer, the so called <em>analyticalengine</em>. It starts by telling the story of Ada Lovelace&apos;s coming ofage. And, in particular, about her being deliberately pushed intomathematics and kept away from fulfilling any kind of creative purpose.That, of course, doesn&apos;t go well for too long, before Ada startslearning about &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers. A concept, so seemingly close topoetry (and madness), her mother becoming worried that Ada could becomelike her father. A mad polyamorous poet?</p><p>Anyways, apart from the stories about Ada and her companion CharlesBabbage, there&apos;s lots of mathematical concepts being nicely animated incomic style. And so there&apos;s also this part where Ada&apos;s imagination quiteliterally starts blossoming when she realizes that numbers do not onlyexist on a single dimension. The book visualizes this really beautifullyby Ada literally walking along the scale of real numbers, soon realizingthat she can carefully climb up <em>imaginary</em> stairs. And so sheclimbs carefully, but misses a stair at one point and falls &quot;back intoreality&quot;. Yup, I know, the book is pretty cool.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/ada.png"></p><p>Sometimes I just wish, I had the imagination of Ada, when back incollege (or was it high school?), my teachers desperately tried toexplain me the concept of imaginary numbers. I mean, it was not that Ididn&apos;t want to understand, or that I was lazy or not interested. It wasjust that this whole topic didn&apos;t make much sense to me. Why haveimaginary numbers when all you need in the world is real numbers. Afterall, there&apos;s no imaginary sheep you could count, and no imaginary applesyou could add up. And so the concept of imaginary numbers actually neverstuck with me. Funnily enough, when we learned about vectors later, Ididn&apos;t have any troubles following along.</p><p>Maybe, it&apos;s that concept of telling a story, of opening up someone&apos;simagination that ultimately allows us to learn and be truly creative.And with that, I&apos;d like to talk about <em>imaginary monies</em>.</p><p>See, in my view, the world today is quite behind its potential. Whenit comes to money, at least. It&apos;s now been, what?, 50 years since theadvent of personal computers and 20 years since the mainstream adoptionof the world wide web? And still, we seem to transact like hundreds ofyears ago.</p><p>But the world has changed. In fact, it changed already in the 70ies,when we found ourselves at the advent of the <em>information age</em>and the founding of the information society. You don&apos;t believe me? Well,then get into this red-looking and playful-looking time machine belowand see for yourself!</p><div class="owl-media owl-video owl-youtube"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UiMus1FJb9w" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Isn&apos;t it beautiful? To me, at least, it&apos;s almost like time-travelingand having a dialogue with the collective of humans that wereresponsible for creating what we now call the internet. It&apos;s inspiring,because these random strangers talk so clearly and freely about <em>ourworld</em>. It&apos;s so frightening, because today, at least, I&apos;d argue,we&apos;re often preceiving <em>their utopia</em> as <em>ourdystopia</em>.</p><p>That does tie nicely into the metaphor of Ada Lovelace climingimaginary stairs. What would happend if she fell from high up back toreality? How hard would the impact be? How long would she fall? Wouldshe bounce back up? Or only leave a hole in the ground? Hard to say, butI&apos;d imagine the impact to be less severe than you&apos;d think. After all,why should gravity only act in one dimension &#x1F60F;. And so that&apos;s why Ithink we should start exploring radically new paths. Not paths,dimensions. Dimensions of money. Imaginary monies.</p><p><em>Tim. Hold on. What the fuck are you talking about???</em> Okokok.Hear me out! Just one, one last story and then you&apos;ll understand!</p><p>Sooo, in the early 2000s the www was really cool. And everybodybought stocks and all nerds got rich and it was great. It was so greatthat even traditional or established businesses wanted to go full<em>cyber</em> by hosting their own websites. One of them was the NewYork Times, an organization founded a staggering 150 years earlier.</p><p>Now, back in the days, publishing websites was quite difficult. Therewere hardly any tools. I guess there weren&apos;t many developers neither.But most probably, the bigest problem was that people were stuck in acreative loop of <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation">HyperNormalization</a>.That is, they didn&apos;t know what to do with the internet. Maybe, they werescared? And so in 1996 it happened that the New York Times simplydecided to scan their front page print and upload it daily as an imageon their website. They were so proud, they even published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/22/business/the-new-york-times-introduces-a-web-site.html">anarticle</a> about themselves, quoting a consultant saying: <em>&quot;Themarket is booming for newspapers on the World Wide Web.&quot;</em></p><p>Little did they know... that you can&apos;t just scan your print editionnewspaper and upload a picture to your website, because, as McLuhan hadrealized years before already: <em>&quot;The medium is the message.&quot;</em> Andhence, the closest resemblence to a truly cyberspacial newspaper may beTwitter, Mastodon or Medium. Well, I guess that consultant was rightafter all.</p><p>And that my friends, is the epic saga of Hypernormalizations beingborn and dying, as they too, can be overcome with a simple trick of themind: Imagination.</p><p>Today, there&apos;s a particular topic that needs more imagination andthat is, as I&apos;ve already mentioned, the topic of money. Honestly, Ithink, we&apos;d be fine in climbing the invisible stairs. We&apos;re collectivelyand subliminally aware of transactional relationships and keepingledgers in our brain. David Graeber&apos;s 5000 Years of debt certainly isproof enough of that. I don&apos;t think we&apos;d fall far, as in our deerestneed, there&apos;s many tricks and protocols in our cultures already.</p><p>So then, let&apos;s explore multi dimensional imaginary money and leavethese real and boring concepts behind! ERC20 tokens as reputation on thethe Ethereum mainnet. Naaaah, that&apos;s so 2019. What we build is areputation token that, acts as a multiplier for our base supply ofmoney!</p><p>Quadratic voting and reputation schemes? Artificially limitted andcarefully distributed token supplies? Naaahh, instead, why don&apos;t we make<em>political influence</em> quadratically proportional to your actualspending power? You know, making your reputation the base, and yourmoney the exponent.</p><p>Let&apos;s say we all agree to vote once in a big election. But then youvote twice. Well, now you better have some stash saved under yourmatress, because you&apos;ve significantly decreased your spending power butincreased your political reach.</p><p>I mean, just imagine the possibilities in cybespace, where therelationship of monetary supply and political influence couldn&apos;tpossibly grow exponentially or lineraly. But instead, where we couldlimit them through governance by adjusting <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.65952em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">i</span></span></span></span>, in:</p><p><span class="katex-display"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>z</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">z = a + bi</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.04398em;">z</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">a</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">b</span><span class="mord mathdefault">i</span></span></span></span></span></p><p>where <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">z</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.04398em;">z</span></span></span></span> being the individual&apos;sspending power, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">a</span></span></span></span> being theindividual&apos;s money supply and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">b</span></span></span></span> being,for example, the individual&apos;s political influence.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/imaginary.png" alt="You guessed it right, I stole that picture from Wikipedia."><figcaption aria-hidden="true">You guessed it right, I stole thatpicture from Wikipedia.</figcaption></figure><p>I know, it sounds like a long shot now.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You all love margarine, right? It&apos;s the plant-based version ofbutter. Actually, I learned about margarine the first time when I was inhigh school.</p><p>In economics class, our teacher tried to explain to us the concept ofsubstitution goods and so he made an example and said: &quot;A substitutegood is a good that can be used in place of another.&quot;<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup> Then he continued: &quot;Butter and margarine arecommonly referred to as substitution goods. In the kitchen, they can beused almost interchangeably. If one day, you go grocery shopping andcan&apos;t find butter, it&apos;s likely not a problem as you&apos;ll survive the weekwithout major hiccups on margarine too&quot;.</p><p>And then, he took the chalk and drew a weird graph on to the boardthat probably nobody in the room fully understood.</p><p>That was roughly 12 years ago. And since then, I thought aboutsubstitution goods quite a few times. It was the usual subjects.Coca-Cola and Pepsi, McDonald&apos;s, and BurgerKing. Taking a train vs.buying a car.</p><p>But then today, I had to explain a friend of mine the concept of asubstitution good, and I intuitively used the example of my teacher:Butter and margarine. But as soon as the words left my mouth, I thoughtto myself: Poor cows!</p><p>OK, OK. Let&apos;s rewind a bit. Also, let me give some context.</p><p>First off, I live in Berlin. And everyone here wants to save theworld. With the purest intention. So even though you won&apos;t notice itmuch visiting the city, my peers are incredibly political. But not thestandard &quot;political&quot; YUPPIE you&apos;re thinking. The Berlin youth<em>lives</em> their lives according to strict principles. To theuttermost extend. Quite often, even so much that it burdens friendships.Especially, when you&apos;re a vegetarian-diet-red-pill-immune person like Iam<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>.</p><p>Anyways, beginning last year, I started noticing a trend in how myflatmates and I feed ourselves. Mainly because this big sausage company,called &quot;R&#xFC;genwalder M&#xFC;hle,&quot; had begun to expand their meat-free meatsubstitution products immensely. My die-hard vegetarian flatmate one daycame into the kitchen and started a chorus of praise about <a href="https://www.ruegenwalder.de/produkte/vegetarische-muehlen-cordon-bleu">R&#xFC;genwalder&apos;svegetarian Cordonbleus</a>. Since each package comes with two, he threwthem in a pan, and shortly we were eating analog meat with analog cheeseinside.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/ruegenwalder.png"></p><p>And what can I say? I actually liked these more than I liked<em>real</em> Cordonbleus. Simply because I&apos;ve always had this childhoodtrauma of eating an animal. Even today, every time I bite into a pieceof meat, I secretly hope its taste won&apos;t connect much to how the animalsmells. I don&apos;t know. To me, that&apos;s just terrible as I grew upsurrounded by animals in a small Swabian village. It breaks my heart andalso utterly disgusts me when my body tells me that what I&apos;m eating hadbeen alive just a while ago.</p><p>But with these Cordonbleus, things were much different<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>! I felt like I could really binge onthose things. No harm is done to animals! I technically can just eat 17of them today without feeling bad! Also, they taste so great withSriracha sauce. It was just too good to be true!</p><p>And so I lived happily, binging on all the great R&#xFC;genwalderCordonbleus until today when I had to explain this damn concept of asubstitution good to a friend of mine.</p><p>See, in my opinion, we&apos;ve enslaved animals within our capitalisticsystem. We&apos;re extracting goods from them without their consent andselling them on the open market. Some policies regulate on how we shouldbe treating animals and gladly, there are BIO labels. I genuinelybelieve that things <em>are</em> objectively getting &quot;better.&quot; By thenumbers, at least.</p><p>What nobody really questions, however, is if the cow would revoketheir consent of giving milk if it could. Sadly, though, if you modelthe brain of the <em>Bos Taurus Economicus</em>, the rational cow, Ibelieve it wouldn&apos;t necessarily revoke its consent immediately.</p><p>Why? Because it has been domesticated towards what it is today forhundreds, if not thousands of years by humans. I&apos;m sure some of you haveseen the Netflix documentaries too. <a href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/">Cowspiracy</a>. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/Title/70100084">Milk</a>. There are somany of these now. Likely and sadly, because cows are now also seen as asignificant reason for climate change. The point of them is that cowstoday are massively optimized for giving milk and meat. They can barelylive on their own. They require human help to survive because we&apos;vedomesticated them for maximum profit.</p><p>OK. But what has all of this to do with butter and margarine? Well,for that, we need to enter Donna Haraway&apos;s <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/staying-with-the-trouble">&quot;Staying withthe Trouble.&quot;</a> In it, she argues that humanity is currently findingitself in the Anthropocene, a geological epoch that&apos;s dating from thecommencement of significant human impact on Earth&apos;s geology andecosystems (I stole that 100% from Wikipedia btw.). But she goes evenfurther and argues that much of the biology and nature that weexperience today has very much been influenced by humanity&apos;shistory.</p><p>She talks about how loving carrier pigeons may be the reason for thestory of Romeo and Juliet to exist. But not only that, but she alsochallenges us by arguing that we humans have an individualresponsibility to be <em>response-able</em> towards the domestic animalsour ancestors and we have &quot;co-created&quot;. She argues for &quot;making kin, notbabies.&quot; And in general, she argues from a truly-inspiring and honestway of &quot;making kin in the Chthulucene. Chthulucene, being her suggestionfor naming Earth&apos;s next geological epoch.</p><p>Most importantly, however, Donna Haraway argues for a strategy shecalls &quot;becoming-with.&quot; Essentially a practical way for all critters tolive and die on &quot;terra. I understand it as follows:</p><p>We&apos;ve inherited this world. It&apos;s full of trouble, but that&apos;s OK.Because each and every one of us has the individual capability to beresponse-able (to act on our own responsibility). Some of us have quitehuge response-ability. Some of us have very small. And some arein-between. Note that she&apos;s not particularly making response-ability aglobal task. Instead, she&apos;s deliberately making it <em>sympoietic</em>(collectively-producing, decentral control) and not <em>autopoietic</em>(self-producing, central control).</p><p>To me, that&apos;s beauty in its purest form. Why? Because it gives eachand every one of us quite concrete guidelines on how we should acttowards enslaved and domesticated animals. We should behave towards themin our personal, most morally-sound way. Maybe, today it just meanspetting a dog or not eating that burger. Well, tomorrow, it can meanfeeding thousands of pigs and not having them slaughtered by an insanemonopolized industry.</p><p>OK. But should I buy butter or margarine now??? Well, I think that&apos;sa decision entirely up to you! I&apos;d still like to make a point aboutsubstitution goods that I hope vegetarians and vegans may appreciate.It&apos;s indeed coming from my heart and with no ill intentions in mind.Also, a disclaimer. I haven&apos;t really researched this whole point, sowhile it may be rhetorically correct, factually, it may not. But maybeit&apos;s also up to the readers to verify and conduct studies! My idea withthis essay is less to convince you about e.g., buying butter overmargarine, and more about the way we can think about today&apos;s problemsfrom an ethical and also economical point of view. So here we go:</p><p>Butter and margarine are substitution goods, meaning they&apos;retechnically interchangeable in the kitchen. Butter is made from cows&apos;milk. Margarine is purely plant-based. As cows have to be fed withplants, but since plants only require water and sun, we can simplyassume that for the purpose of a cooking-fat, margarine is moreefficient to produce and hence over a long period a cheap alternative tobutter.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/substitute.jpg"></p><p>Assuming you, e.g., increased the price of butter to improve theliving conditions of a cow, it&apos;d mean that you&apos;d decrease butter&apos;sdemand, and at the same time, you&apos;d increase margarine&apos;s demand andhence its price. At least in the short term, it could be argued thatgiven the market&apos;s structure, vegetarian substitute goods are notcontributing towards less animal suffering. Instead, the opposite may beright.</p><p>Of course, this becomes even more problematic, the more industryprocesses and products are replacing animal-based ingredients withplant-based alternatives. Not only are plant-based substitutesstructurally cheaper to produce as you simply don&apos;t have to feed animalswith plants to create them. But additionally, given the fact that you&apos;retaking money away, that is paying, e.g., &quot;a cow&apos;s rent,&quot; you&apos;re alsocontributing towards more efficiently extracting value from animals andhence to more extreme animal suffering.</p><p>In simpler terms: The fewer money farmers have to feed and maintaintheir life stock, the more they&apos;ll have the incentive to squeeze outevery last penny. And judging by my intuition, that will undoubtedlymean more suffering for the animal.</p><p>Oh jeez...</p><p>Yeah, I know! The situation looks quite dire. Well, yes, it does. Butalso it doesn&apos;t. Because we&apos;ve just looked at cows as rational actorsand we&apos;ve also learned what it means to be a good companion speciestowards cows. We have to become-with with them and actresponse-able!</p><p>So instead of calling on our politicians to create more rules andcomplexity, I&apos;d like to encourage you today to think like a genuinecapitalist. Assuming that we want to move the world over tovegetarianism or veganism. Considering that we want to optimize for aslittle animal slavery and suffering: What are economic policies thatcould help cows, pigs, and chickens to live and die peacefully duringthis phase of <em>aninomic</em> (animal + economic) turmoil? What canhelp in the long-term? What&apos;s a solution that could be applied today?Think, discuss, write!</p><p>Here&apos;s my take on one idea:</p><p>Venture capitalists always talk about Universal Basic Income fortheir sacred entrepreneurs. Well, why can&apos;t we have one for cows??? Forexample, couldn&apos;t we simply have a tax on e.g., eggplants that wouldcontribute towards CUBI (cow universal basic income)? Mainly, it&apos;d be apolicy, financing the board and lodge of &quot;unemployed&quot; cows all over theworld. What&apos;s stopping us from doing that? I&apos;d pay for it. Wouldyou?</p><p>Also, what policies would you like to create?</p><hr><h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2><ul><li>We had an interesting discussion about this article, over in the <a href="https://leapdao.slack.com/archives/C2KNAV6E5/p1587027688144900">LeapDAOSlack</a>.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2><p><small><a name="f1">1</a>: Actually, I copied that from Wikipedia.But he said something very similar, I believe.<a href="#a1">&#x2191;</a></small></p><p><small><a name="f2">2</a>: By the way, I want to be vegetarian, butso far, I&apos;ve been struggling with sublements etc. But that&apos;s a story foranother time.<a href="#a2">&#x2191;</a></small></p><p><small><a name="f3">3</a>: Take this section with a grain of salt.R&#xFC;genwalder&apos;s Cordonbleus today are only vegetarian.

That field being digital audioengineering. So when some of my freelance projects ended in November2019, I decided to allocate my next three months towards building anaudio product.</p><p>I quickly discovered what I wanted to build: A synthesizer. In C++! Ihad just watched some talks on WebAssembly, and was very curious tolearn a new language too! In hindsight, the personal challenge, however,was to understand the data structures and math that go into generatingaudio.</p><p>That&apos;s the story of how I rediscovered the beauty of mathematicsthrough building a synthesizer with C++ and WebAssembly.</p><h2 id="theory">Theory</h2><p>I had never done anything in the field of music technology - I had tostart at zero practically. It meant I had to look at the physical,mathematical, and musical fundamentals of audio generation.</p><h3 id="the-nyquist-shannon-sampling-theorem">The Nyquist-ShannonSampling Theorem</h3><p>Sound is a time-dependent phenomenon. Regular instruments takeadvantage of this phenomenon by emitting sound waves over time through,e.g., a mechanical part oscillating. That produces a time-continuousanalog signal, which means that for each point in time, the signalproduces a unique value in amplitude. Computers can merely approximateanalog values by sampling them into time-discrete values. They&apos;re sogood at approximating that the digital representation of an analogsignal virtually becomes indistinguishable to a human&apos;s ear. As long asthe sampling complies with some basic rules of signal processing, atleast.</p><p>A pretty fundamental principle in this regard is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist&#x2013;Shannonsampling theorem</a>. It states that to capture all necessaryinformation from a continuous-time signal, a function<em>&quot;sampling&quot;</em> the signal needs to record data at least at a ratetwice as frequently as the highest frequency. If this requirement isunfulfilled, then the resulting digital signal contains an artifactcalled <em>&quot;Aliasing&quot;</em>, distorting the familiarity of the originalsignal (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sawtooth-aliasingdemo.ogg">Listento this sound bit of aliasing happening on a sawtooth wave</a>).</p><p>Though we&apos;re not planning to record analog signal to digital, we&apos;llstill have to comply with this theorem, as synthesizing sound is nothingmore than filling a list with time-discrete values too<sup id="a5"><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>. Practically, it may look something likethis:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">// Simple pseudo code noise generator</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">context = new AudioContext()</span><br><span class="line">samples = []</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">for (i = 0; i &lt; context.sampleRate; i++) {</span><br><span class="line">  // Generate noise</span><br><span class="line">  samples.append(random.choice([0, 1]))</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">// We&apos;ve generated enough samples for exactly 1 second.</span><br><span class="line">// The output will hence be 1 second of noise.</span><br><span class="line">context.play(samples)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here, we&apos;re initiating a new <code>AudioContext</code> object,getting its sample rate, and generating enough samples to have the noiselast for at least one second. Admittedly, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem isless of a problem here, as the <code>sampleRate</code> is likely to beset to a reasonable value by our pseudo language&apos;s magical<code>AudioContext</code>. But assuming it was set to only 200 Hertz,outputting a piano&apos;s middle C (its frequency is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies">261.6256Hertz</a>) would already be corrupted, as the required 261 repetitionsper second to output middle C wouldn&apos;t fit into the 200 repetitions persecond of the sample rate. Practically, what would happen is that oursampling algorithm would be &quot;overtaken&quot; by middle C&apos;s frequency andhence output a shifted version. The figure below nicely visualizes theeffect, showing what happens if we&apos;re gradually increasing the signal&apos;sfrequency at a steady sampling rate.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/nyquist.png" alt="Undersampling: The signal&apos;s frequency is increased while the sampling rate (dotted line) remains steady."><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>Undersampling: The signal&apos;s frequencyis increased while the sampling rate (dotted line) remainssteady.</em></figcaption></figure><p>But assuming a sufficient sampling rate, there&apos;s another problem withthe above code. Imagine, we substituted the noise-producing snippet witha nice-sounding sine wave and then integrated and sold it as a hardwaresynthesizer. When pressing a key, the player would hear the respectivetone for a second. Pressing another key, they&apos;d hear another tone foranother second and so on. But since we built our function only togenerate static-length tones of a one-second length, it wouldn&apos;t be muchfun making music, as playing rhythmic patterns would be impossible!</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/frames.png" alt="Large buffer sizes can introduce latency for the user6."><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>Large buffer sizes can introducelatency for the user<sup id="a6"><a href="#f6">6</a></sup>.</em></figcaption></figure><p>That&apos;s because music doesn&apos;t work on an absolute time scale, but on arelative one. We wouldn&apos;t say that a note &quot;lasts for a second&quot;. Instead,we&apos;d say it &quot;lasts for a quarter bar&quot; and, hence, call it a &quot;quarternote&quot;. To build a software instrument, this means that we&apos;ll have tooptimize for real-time responsiveness and maximum expressiveness. Forthis, we&apos;ll need specific data structures.</p><h3 id="frames-and-ring-buffers">Frames and Ring Buffers</h3><p>Generally, audio in programming languages is most commonly generatedby continuously filling up buffers with data points and then sendingthem to the sound card. But as we&apos;ve just learned, that buffer&apos;s sizedetermines the responsiveness of our instrument. An idea that nicelydissolves this problem is to chunk our buffer into <em>frames</em>.Instead of sending a fixed-length buffer of samples to the outputdevice, we chunk it into small <em>frames</em> and continuously sendthese. In theory, we&apos;d limit the size of a frame to a single sample formaximum responsiveness, meaning we&apos;d now be <em>&quot;streaming&quot;</em> ourdata. But given that timing is crucial too, we&apos;ll have to come up withyet another strategy for sending just the right amount of data in agiven time frame. For this, we can use a different concept called a<em>&quot;ring buffer&quot;</em>.</p><figure><img src="/assets/images/ring-buffer.gif" alt="A ring buffer processing a keyboard&apos;s inputs."><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>A ring buffer processing a keyboard&apos;sinputs.</em></figcaption></figure><p>A ring buffer is a fixed-size list, managed by two distinct pointers,where one pointer is writing values, and the other one is &quot;chasing&quot; andconsuming those values. It allows a program to continuously stream data,precisely at the speed of the chasing pointer. Additionally, it providesdevelopers with a <em>&quot;pull&quot;</em> rather than a <em>&quot;push&quot;</em> API.Now, instead of having to optimize their program to push new frames tothe output device periodically, a developer can use the callbackfunction of a ring buffer&apos;s writing pointer to be notified about ashortage of fresh data.</p><p>But so much for theory. Let&apos;s explore how we can implement theseconcepts in practice.</p><h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2><p>As we&apos;ve discussed the most important theoretical concepts in theprevious section, we can now move into the implementation phase.Specifically, we&apos;ll highlight three distinct issues that we had toovercome.</p><h3 id="using-the-audioworklet">Using the <code>AudioWorklet</code></h3><p>Today, there&apos;s sadly no cross-browser API fully implementing all theabove concepts. That requires <em>some</em> improvisation when trying tobuild a synthesizer for the web. Naively, one might think that<code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> allow one toimplement a ring buffer quickly. However, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29972322/1263876">their accuracy can&apos;tbe trusted</a><sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>. Alternatively, there&apos;s the web audioAPI&apos;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScriptProcessorNode"><code>ScriptProcessorNode</code></a>.And while it allows hooking into the output device&apos;s streaming process,it still requires a <em>push</em> approach, as inserting just the rightamount of samples per second into the output stream is kept to thedeveloper. Additionally, <code>ScriptProcessorNode</code> has beendeprecated without any reasonable cross-browser compatible alternativeavailable since 2014. Yikes!</p><p><a href="https://blog.mecheye.net/2017/09/i-dont-know-who-the-web-audio-api-is-designed-for/">Sowhat now?</a> Luckily, <code>ScriptProcessorNode</code>&apos;s deprecationhappened years ago already.

First, we extend our class with the<code>AudioWorkletProcessor</code> interface class and implement themandatory <code>process(inputs, output, parameter)</code> function.<code>process</code> allows us to access all currently available audio<code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code> and <em>process</em> them.We won&apos;t have to add them to the function&apos;s <code>return</code>statement, as we&apos;re manipulating them by reference. Conveniently,<code>process</code> is called for us by the <code>AudioWorklet</code>every time the output device needs data.</p><p>In terms of understanding, it really helped me think of the<code>AudioWorklet</code> as a ring buffer. It&apos;s implementation isn&apos;t aring buffer. But that metaphor served me well for getting a betterintuition.</p>        <iframe frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-top-navigation" seamless

things in this post aboutWebAssembly and C++ too. It turns out, that was the most natural part!Yes, being a JavaScript developer, C++ looked foreign at first, and Iwas a bit scared of pointers, and the raw-ness C++ radiated. But,overall, it wasn&apos;t entirely new territory for me as I already understoodmany of its concepts from previous projects (e.g., working with theshell or Ethereum Solidity). To kickstart development, I bought&quot;Accelerated C++&quot; by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo. I read parts ofit but then dove fully into coding. The book is excellent. I canrecommend it!</p><p>The same goes for emscripten and WebAssembly. There are a fewgotchas, and I&apos;m writing about one particular in the Appendix of thispost. Overall, WebAssembly&apos;s tooling is already surprisingly usable andeasily integrated into a standard front end build pipeline.</p><p>I had initially decided on C++ and WASM for the performance boost.Now, I take much more joy out being able to separate my code base byconcerns nicely. Writing all audio code in C++ and all user interfacecode in JavaScript led to a loose coupling and nice modularization. Inoticed that I not only wrote a fully-fledged audio library in C++through this but also that it&apos;s portable to anywhere WebAssembly runs!That&apos;s super cool!</p><h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2><p>WASM Synth turned out to be a great learning experience.

was: &quot;How do Iintegrate WebAssembly into my regular web app build, without bloating ittoo much?&quot;. To put things into perspective: I had just recently switchedfrom Webpack to rollup.js as I was sick of spending hours setting upWebpack with its ten thousand magic configuration options.</p><p>To my surprise, however, neither framework has reasonable defaultsfor handling WebAssembly yet. Notably, when we generated the WebAssemblyoutputs using emscripten and they <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/04/loading-wasm">grewbigger than 4KB</a>. But there were other problems too:</p><ul><li>rollup.js bundles all source file into a single JavaScriptfile.</li><li>Booting the app, also means booting react.js, which itself starts acontinuous process that we&apos;ll somehow have to take into account.</li><li>emscripten generates a <code>.wasm</code> and a <code>.js</code>file. The <code>.wasm</code> file contains all C++ source code as wellas WebAssembly instructions. The <code>.js</code> file acts as the gluebetween WebAssembly and JavaScript.<ul><li>In some cases, there&apos;s this 4KB size limit on loading<code>.wasm</code> files</li><li>The emscripten <code>.js</code> glue code is super useful. I canrecommend including it into your code deliverable.</li></ul></li><li>The <code>AudioWorklet</code> is supposed to be included into thepage by using <code>new AudioContext().addModule(&lt;path&gt;)</code><ul><li>It has a separate global scope. But emscripten&apos;s glue code relies onthe global scope too (<code>Module</code> object)</li></ul></li><li>Rollup.js doesn&apos;t have good defaults or plugins for bundlingemscripten-generated <code>.wasm</code> code.</li></ul><p>In the end, this led me to build a custom pipeline to bundleemscripten builds every time my source changed. But before I explainhow, let&apos;s take a step back to understand how emscripten&apos;s compilationworks.</p><p>On installation, emscripten exports a command-line utility called<code>emcc</code> into the shell. To demonstrate its capabilities, let&apos;stry compiling the <code>Hello World</code> example from the beginning ofthe post:</p><figure class="highlight c++"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="keyword">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">#<span class="keyword">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;emscripten/bind.h&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> <span class="keyword">namespace</span> emscripten;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">std::string <span class="title">hello</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>{</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;hello world&quot;</span>;</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> Using embind, we can define `hello`&apos;s external name</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS</span>(my_module) {</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">function</span>(<span class="string">&quot;hello&quot;</span>, &amp;hello);</span><br><span class="line">}</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To make it executable by a browser, we&apos;ll use <code>emcc</code> tocompile it to a <code>.wasm</code> and a <code>.js</code> file.</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ emcc main.cc --<span class="built_in">bind</span> -WASM=1 -o main.js</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><code>emcc</code> here simply compiles all functions contained in<code>main.cc</code> into a <code>main.wasm</code> file. Besides, italso generates this glue code (<code>main.js</code>) using <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html">Embind</a>.It allows us to invoke functions, initially written in C++, directlyfrom within JavaScript as if they were just regular classes. So to makeemscripten&apos;s outputs work correctly, we&apos;ll have to include the<code>.js</code> into the page. On the initialization of the page,emscripten&apos;s clue code is loading the <code>.wasm</code> fileasynchronously. Through some trick, the browser skips the 4KB file sizelimit, and all our C++ classes are now available as native JSclasses:</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">html</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">body</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">&quot;wasm/main.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="language-javascript"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">      <span class="title class_">Module</span>.<span class="property">onRuntimeInitialized</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>) {</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">        <span class="variable language_">console</span>.<span class="title function_">log</span>(<span class="title class_">Module</span>.<span class="title function_">hello</span>());</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">      }</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="language-javascript">    </span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">body</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">html</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So far, so good. But, as I&apos;ve mentioned previously, one of theproblems now is that the <code>AudioWorklet</code>, being spawned in aseparate thread with a separate global scope, won&apos;t be aware ofemscripten&apos;s <code>window.Module</code>. So how do we export code fromwithin a Worklet?</p><p>After spending quite some time researching that question, Idiscovered that the Google Chrome Labs team <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/master/audio-worklet/design-pattern/wasm/index.html">recommends</a>transpiling all JavaScript source into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">nativemodules</a> and then simply use ES6&apos;s <code>import from</code> syntax.Well, it turns out the JS modules syntax <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">isn&apos;twidely supported yet</a>, particularly not in <code>Workers</code>, letalone <code>Worklets</code>...</p><p><img src="/assets/images/import-support.png"></p><p>But luckily, after banging my head another few days against JSmodules and other fancy new front end frameworks, I found a surprisinglysimple trick.</p><p>I reduce emscripten&apos;s outputs to a single <code>.js</code> file thatcontains the <code>.wasm</code> as base64 string using it&apos;s<code>-s SINGLE_FILE=1</code> option. As we need emscripten&apos;s<code>.js</code> file to define <code>window.Module</code> in the<code>AudioWorklet</code>&apos;s global scope, I then simply append theemscripten JavaScript file with the <code>AudioWorklet</code>&apos;JavaScript file to make them configure the same global scope. Thatallows me to execute WebAssembly from within a Worklet without using thepoorly supported <code>import from</code> syntax. Ultimately, I ended upwith the following bash script (or on <a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth/blob/master/scripts/build.sh">GitHub</a>):</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">DIR=<span class="string">&quot;.wasm&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> Generates the .wasm directory if it doesn&apos;t exist yet.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> [ ! -d <span class="variable">$DIR</span> ]; <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">mkdir</span> <span class="variable">$DIR</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">fi</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># NOTE `-std`: To use modern c++11 features like std::tuple and std::vector,</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># we need to enable C++ 11 by passing the parameter to clang through emcc.</span></span><br><span class="line">emcc src/cpp/*.cc \</span><br><span class="line">  -std=c++11 \</span><br><span class="line">  -O1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s WASM=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s BINARYEN_ASYNC_COMPILATION=0 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s SINGLE_FILE=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  -s MODULARIZE=1 \</span><br><span class="line">  --<span class="built_in">bind</span> \</span><br><span class="line">  -o <span class="variable">$DIR</span>/main.js</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># <span class="doctag">NOTE:</span> We concat the emscripten generated js and wasm file with the worklet</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># such that we don&apos;t have to import it later as an es6 module.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>(Disclaimer: Dieser Post ist &quot;Work in Progress&quot;. Ich arbeite nocham perfekten Sauerteigbrot. Die Angaben auf dieser Seite werden sichalso sehr wahrscheinlich noch verbessern.)</em></p><h2 id="anstellgut-herstellen">Anstellgut herstellen</h2><p>Um ein Sauerteigbrot zu backen wird zun&#xE4;chst ein<em>&quot;Anstellgut&quot;</em> ben&#xF6;tigt. Ein Anstellgut ist einfach vergorenesMehl und Wasser. Milchs&#xE4;urebakterien auf der Schale einiger Getreidetreiben diese G&#xE4;rung vorran und so entwickelt sich eine nat&#xFC;rlicheHefekultur. Verschiedene Mehle (Roggen oder Weizen) produzierenverschiedene Anstellg&#xFC;ter.</p><p>Ein Anstellgut kann sehr einfach &#xFC;ber eine Dauer von f&#xFC;nf Tagenhergestellt werden. Dazu am besten <a href="https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/916071197018348/Sauerteig.html">diesem</a>Rezept folgen.</p><p>Einige Anmerkungen zu diesem Rezept:</p><ul><li><p>Wenn Ihr spontan keinen dauerhaft-warmen Platz in eurer Wohnungfinden k&#xF6;nnt, bspw. im Winter, dann stellt euer Gef&#xE4;&#xDF; einfach in eurenBackofen und macht die Lampe an. Dessen Hitze sorgt f&#xFC;r konstante 30&#xB0;Cim Ofen und damit f&#xFC;r das ideale Klima f&#xFC;r eineSauerteigverhefung.</p></li><li><p>Eine Anfangsmenge von 100g Mehl + 100g Wasser produzieren eineMenge Anstellgut. Man kann die Angaben im Rezept also auch guthalbieren.</p></li></ul><h2 id="anstellgut-am-leben-erhalten">Anstellgut am Leben erhalten</h2><p>Dar&#xFC;ber wie man das Anstellgut am Besten am Leben erh&#xE4;lt gibt eswiderspr&#xFC;chliche Angaben im Netz. Foodblogger auf Youtube empfehlenmeist das Anstellgut permanent bei Zimmertemperatur zu lagern und mind.1x am Tag, optimalerweise aber 2x am Tag mit 1EL Mehl + 4 EL lauwarmemWasser zu f&#xFC;ttern. Alternativ kann das Anstellgut aber anscheinend auchim K&#xFC;hlschrank gelagert werden und nur 1x die Woche mit 1EL Mehl + 4 ELlauwarmem Wasser gef&#xFC;ttert werden. Wird es allerdings im K&#xFC;hlschrankgelagert, ist eine <em>&quot;Reaktivierung&quot;</em> n&#xF6;tig. Hierzu wird, das sichim &quot;Winterschlaf&quot; befindliche Anstellgut, &#xFC;ber einige Tage mit neuerNahrung (Mehl + Wasser) versorgt um den eigentlichen Brotteig dann miteinem sehr aktiven Anstellgut zu backen.</p><p>Seine Strategie sollte man also davon abh&#xE4;ngig machen wie spontanoder wie oft man Brot backen m&#xF6;chte.</p><p>Kleiner Tipp: Da eine t&#xE4;gliche F&#xFC;tterung nat&#xFC;rlich Unmengen anAnstellgut &#xFC;ber Zeit generiert, w&#xFC;rde dass ja auch logischerweise hei&#xDF;enoft Brot backen zu m&#xFC;ssen (oder Teile des Anstellgut wegzuwerfen). Mankann aus dem Anstellgut allerdings auch sehr leckere kleinereFr&#xFC;hst&#xFC;ckssnacks braten. Also nicht weg werfen! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVx2oFFptG0">Idee f&#xFC;r einenSnack</a>.</p><h2 id="sauerteigbrot-backen">Sauerteigbrot backen</h2><p><em>(Dieses Rezept ist WIP. Ich experimentiere noch. Au&#xDF;erdem fehlenmir z.T. auch noch die richtigen Zutaten.)</em></p><p>Zutaten:</p><ul><li>225g Weizenmehl (Type 550)</li><li>112g Dinkelmehl (Type 1050)</li><li>25g Roggenmehl (Type 1150)</li><li>75g Anstellgut</li><li>190g Wasser</li><li>1 Eigelb</li><li>Salz (nach Gef&#xFC;hl)</li><li>Erbsengro&#xDF;es St&#xFC;ck Hefe (nur wenn Anstellgut noch &quot;jung&quot; ist)</li></ul><p>Alle oben angebenen Zutaten, au&#xDF;er das Salz in einer gro&#xDF;en Sch&#xFC;sselmischen. Ihr bekommt einen ziemlich w&#xE4;ssrigen Teig, aber das istvollkommen OK. Dann einfach mit einer Frischhaltefolie oder einemfeuchten Tuch &#xFC;ber Nacht in den K&#xFC;hlschrank packen.</p><p>Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass ihr am n&#xE4;chsten Tag nun versucht denTeig schrittweise glatter zu kneten. Jedoch nicht nur durch Zugabe vonMehl, sondern auch durch die richtige Reifung und Knetmechanik! Den Teigalso aus dem K&#xFC;hlschrank holen und salzen. Dann schrittweise ein wenigWeizenmehl hinzu geben, sodass der Teig schleimiger aber fester wird.Ist alles gut verknetet, den Teig bei Raumtemperatur f&#xFC;r 1-2h gehenlassen.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/dough-1.jpg"></p><p>Nach der Ruhe, den Teig wieder aus der Sch&#xFC;ssel holen und ihn aufeine saubere Fl&#xE4;che &quot;werfen und falten&quot;. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APEavQg8rMw&amp;t=200s">DiesesVideo</a> erkl&#xE4;rt die Bewegung gut. Nachdem ihr das ca 10min gemachthabt, Teig wieder in Schale und weiter gehen lassen. Nach und nachsollte sich die Struktur eures Teigs ver&#xE4;ndert. Er wird glatter undweniger schleimig. Er l&#xE4;sst sich nicht nicht so einfach mehr in dieL&#xE4;nge ziehen, etc..</p><p>Diese Art von Kneten einige Male wiederholen und zwischendurch Teigimmer bei Raumtemperatur gehen lassen, bis ihr einen Teig habt der sch&#xF6;nfluffig und glatt ist.</p><p>Um eine sch&#xF6;ne Kruste beim Backen zu erhalten, m&#xFC;sst ihr nun dieOberfl&#xE4;chenspannung des Teigs erh&#xF6;hen. Um dies zu tun, versucht miteuren H&#xE4;nden die unteren Seiten des Teiges in dessen untere Mitte zuziehen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APEavQg8rMw&amp;t=300s">DiesesVideo</a> erkl&#xE4;rt es ein wenig. Ihr m&#xFC;sst nicht genau das im Videomachen. Aber spielt einfach ein wenig mit dem Teig und dann wird euchschon klar werden wie man mehr Spannung drauf bringt! Schlussendlichwollt ihr erreichen, dass auf der zuk&#xFC;nftigen Kruste des BrotsTeigspannung entsteht und dass der Teig nicht einfach zu einem Fladenzusammensackt. Mit dem wiederholten Kneten und gehen lassen baut ihralso Schrittweise die Glutenstruktur des Teigs auf und stabilisiertdiese.</p><p>Habt ihr nun also einen sch&#xF6;nen Teig, dann besorgt euch einenBrotkorb oder eine Sch&#xFC;ssel in die euer Teig passt und legt ein Tuchhinein. Mehlt das Tuch gro&#xDF;z&#xFC;gig und legt den Teig vorsichtighinein.</p><p>Achtung: Man kann den Teig entweder mit seinem &quot;Saum&quot; nach<em>oben</em> oder <em>unten</em> legen. Beim Backen soll euer Brot einwenig aufrei&#xDF;en. Das kann entweder mit einem Messerschnittbewerkstelligt werden, wenn ihr euren Teig mit dem Saum nach oben legt,oder indem des Teigs Saum auf nat&#xFC;rliche Weise im Ofen aufreist.Geschmacksfrage...</p><p>Deckt den Teig in der Sch&#xFC;ssel mit dem &#xFC;bergebliebenen Tuch ab undlasst ihn wieder eine Weile gehen. Irgendwann sollte der Teig dann eineecht &quot;gem&#xFC;tliche&quot; Konsistenz haben wie ein mega weiches Kissen. Beimvorsichtigen dr&#xFC;cken mit einem Finger, sollte der Teig die Kuhle wiederschlie&#xDF;en (siehe Video). Ist dass der Fall, k&#xF6;nnt ihr schon mal den Ofenanheizen!</p><div style="width:100%;height:480px;background-color:black;text-align:center;"><pre><code>&lt;video style=&quot;height:100%;&quot; controls&gt;  &lt;source src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/03COS0G4L24d9Z6SmEbdXHeIdMy35NqD5VGMDFCrxKprnnwUUuujtQsjjiZ25WUwQKr1yuIBOt4NslifVvxtb73BmTjTi8OguAu1ozi-slBP7UzbazQ_c0vn1VMLIEH3D2n_F1FgN8k=m18&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre></div><p>Um das Brot mit einer knusprigen Kruste zu backen, empfielt sich ein<a href="https://amzn.to/309qvrD">Gusseisentopf mit Deckel</a>. Den Ofenauf volle Hitze einstellen und Topf f&#xFC;r 30min vorw&#xE4;rmen.</p><p>Dann muss alles sicher und konzentriert passieren! Den Teig mit einemgemehlten Brett aus eurer Sch&#xFC;ssel st&#xFC;rzen. Den Topf VORSICHTIG mitHandschuhen aus dem Ofen holen, Teig in den Topf geben, (optional: Narbeeinschneiden) und ein wenig Wasser mit der Hand an die Seiten des Topfsspr&#xFC;hen um Wasserdampf zu erzeugen. Dann Deckel drauf (ACHTUNG HEISS!)und ab in den Ofen f&#xFC;r 25min. 220-240&#xB0;C sind gut. Den Deckel unterkeinen Umst&#xE4;nden &#xF6;ffnen.</p><p>Dann nach 25min, Deckel entfernen. Jetzt sollte eigentlich schon dieStruktur der Kruste klar erkennbar sein. In den n&#xE4;chsten +-25min backtihr dann die Br&#xE4;une der Kruste. Daf&#xFC;r den Ofen auf 200-220&#xB0;C stellen undregelm&#xE4;&#xDF;ig einen Blick hineinwerfen. Seit ihr mit eurer Krustezufrieden, einfach das Brot aus dem Topf holen und auf einem Blechk&#xFC;hlen lassen.</p><p>Nicht direkt anschneiden, sondern mehrere Stunden warten um dem BrotZeit zu geben auszuk&#xFC;hlen.</p><p>Alternativ kann nach erreichen einer tollen Krustenfarbe auch derOfen ausgestellt und die T&#xFC;r angelehnt werden. Anscheinend wird das Brotdann extra knusprig (B&#xE4;ckertrick!).</p><p>Hier meine ersten Ergebnisse:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/bread-1.jpg"> <img src="/assets/images/bread-2.jpg"></p><p>Et voila, ihr habt eurer erstes Sauerteigbrot gebacken!

    <title>Reasons to not ship a PoA network</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This story is written in response to &#x201C;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">Oceanon PoA vs. Ethereum Mainnet?</a>&#x201D;. In this article, I&#x2019;ll argue for why Ithink it is a bad choice to ship to a Proof-of-Authority network for aproject that wants to go permission-less in the future.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Proof-of-Authority is an algorithm used in blockchains that deliversfast throughput (tx/s), finality and low fees through a consensusmechanism based on identity as stake. Both Geth and Parity can easilyconfigured to run on POA. It allows projects to orchestrate their ownnetworks that run in parallel to the Ethereum main chain. POA chains canbe configured to be public or private. POA has the followingpositives:</p><ol type="1"><li><p>Finality (time for a block to be confirmed), throughput (e.g.tx/s), latency and fees can be configured, hence compared to theEthereum main chain performance is significantly increased.</p></li><li><p>The Ethereum client running the POA can essentially be customizedsuch that new use cases can be fulfilled. In the case of POA.network&#x2019;sxDai, Dai is the native currency. Transaction fees are paid in Dai. Verycool.</p></li><li><p>POA chains benefit Ethereum. Its main chain is not scaling atthis point. Even though Plasma (e.g. LeapDAO) and L2 (e.g. Raiden) areshipping, many see sidechains (e.g. POA networks) as a viable scalingmechanism.</p></li></ol><p>I introduce Proof-of-Authority chains and their positives. The nextsection dives into the problems of POA networks.</p><h2 id="problems">Problems</h2><p>Firstly, I&#x2019;d like to say that there&#x2019;s nothing inherently wrong withshipping on a POA chain per-se. It&#x2019;s more about the intend behindshipping to POA chains.</p><p>Are you orchestrating a POA chain in your company to issue privatetokens for your employees to send around. Great! Are you shipping apublic plasma-enabled POA chain that allows users to exit the chainfairly. Cool!</p><p>I&#x2019;d like to argue, however, that when your goal is to arrive at apermission-less, decentralized and transparent network, you shouldn&#x2019;tship to POA first. In the following sections, I&#x2019;ll argue for why thatis.</p><h2 id="security-guarantees">Security Guarantees</h2><p>Proof-of-Authority in a public setting is a bad choice, as it hasdifferent security guarantees compared to a PoW or PoS network.</p><div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1102455394838822912"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><ol type="1"><li><p>Users have to trust in your <a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html">wetcode</a>. Or simplified: How nodes are run is essentially defined inlegal documents. Node operators agree to run the nodes according tothese documents. If they don&#x2019;t comply, they&#x2019;ll face legal issues. To myknowledge, no precedence has been set in court yet. Note: I&#x2019;m not alawyer. Building a system with wet code leads, however, to the followingproperties: (A) It&#x2019;s not permission-less as in: Everybody can, withoutthe incurrence of a cost, to innovate or influence on any part of theinfrastructure.(B) It&#x2019;s not necessarily transparent as in: Everybody canfollow the decision-making processes. (C) It&#x2019;s not open as in: Everybodycan choose to join the network without facing gatekeepers.</p></li><li><p>Identity at stake is not a strong incentive for businessesrunning nodes. When the only skin-in-the-game is identity, many nodeoperators fail to even get off the ground. An example: Assume you wantto run a POA network that&#x2019;s about storing data. You get lucky andconvince the Internet Archive to run a node on your network. You promisethem: &#x201C;By running a node on our network, you&#x2019;ll easily break even bycashing-in on the transaction fees&#x201D;. Now here&#x2019;s what would happen: TheInternet Archive is not in the business of running blockchains. Theircore business model doesn&#x2019;t depend on it. That means, in case they failto run a node for some reason, they have almost nothing to lose. OK,then say you convince an aspiring blockchain startup to run a node.They&#x2019;re in the business of making money on blockchains! Well, eventhough they might run the risk of suffering a reputation-crisis, thatwon&#x2019;t affect their bank account much. Depending on their business modeland product, they might still be able to make money. Alright, then let&#x2019;sassume you score one of your customers to run a node. Well in that case,they might actually have vested interest in keeping the network up andrunning. Generally, I&#x2019;d say then: A node operator needs to havesignificant money at stake (or skin in the game) for them to be actingin the interests of the network. Hence, PoS or PoW is usually a goodchoice in a public setting.</p></li><li><p>Collusion of entities is likely. To join a PoA network, entitieswill have to email their public keys back and forth. It makes totalsense for them to stay in touch, as they&#x2019;re responsible for keeping thenetwork up and running. That, however, removes the anonymous nature ofrunning a PoW or PoS network. All of a sudden it becomes very easy forentities to collude. Of course, they&#x2019;re legally bound not to, but aswe&#x2019;ve seen from the previous points, they might not be incentivizedthrough stake to act in the interest of the network.</p></li><li><p>Token-bridges are centralized. There&#x2019;s a reason for Plasma toexist. Essentially, it allows users to exit the chain in case of e.g. a(Byzantine) fault. In Plasma, users don&#x2019;t need the permission of anyauthority to exit. Exits are facilitated through an on-chain contractthat&#x2019;s tracking balances. Token-bridges, in contrast, are likely hostedon cloud providers like AWS by the same organization that&#x2019;s potentiallyalso running a node. This means that when a user transfers money to aPOA chain, they have to not only trust the organizations running thenodes but also organization running the token-bridge!</p></li><li><p>Developers that ship to a POA chain will write different codethan developers shipping on a main net. The security guarantees aresimply different. On POA, developers can easily take short cuts withoutspending much time thinking about the horrors of adversarial opennetworks. Speaking from my own experience, when security guaranteeschange, the code is usually very costly (time and money) toport.</p></li></ol><p>Now that I discussed the security guarantees of a POA network, let&#x2019;smove on to UX.</p><h2 id="user-and-developer-experience">User (and Developer)Experience</h2><p>Running a POA network is going to give users bad experiences forthese reasons:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/clippy.jpg"></p><ol type="1"><li><p>Let&#x2019;s be honest. Today&#x2019;s users struggle to understand whatblockchains are. In deploying a separate network (e.g. POA), users willhave to additionally learn what it is. They&#x2019;ll have to manually set theendpoint in Metamask. They&#x2019;ll have to always remember when to change theMetamask endpoint and for which application. They&#x2019;ll have to understandwhat a token-bridge is. They&#x2019;ll have to do the accounting for how muchof their money is on the POA net vs. main net. Some apps won&#x2019;t allowsetting POA network endpoints. They&#x2019;ll have to understand that eventhough POA addresses look the same as main net addresses, when sendingmoney to a wrong address all their ETH could be gone. Should I go on?Ethereum user interfaces are built for the main net. User educationhappens on the main net. In terms of UX, <a href="https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1099782348562870273">POAnetworks are the FTP protocols of blockchains</a>.</p></li><li><p>Smart contract composability. IMO, the Ethereum killer feature.Essentially, the reason for why we have DeFi today. While token-bridgesallow for cross-chain value transfer, transfer of state isn&#x2019;t possible<a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/why-smart-contracts-are-not-feasible-on-plasma/2598">andlikely won&#x2019;t be in the future</a>. I&#x2019;d like to make this extra clear: Acontract deployed on a POA network will not be able to interact with acontract on the main network through state (e.g. calling functions).Yes, value can be sent through a token-bridge and that means one couldpotentially send ETH/ERC20 from: POA contract -&gt; token-bridge -&gt;e.g. Uniswap. Most DeFi requires the calling of contract&#x2019;s methods,however. Not having smart contract composability leads to the following:(1) Developers will not be able to plug into your contract APIs unlessthey also ship on your POA network. (2) Your projects will not profit asmuch from open-source collaboration, assuming most developers want toship on the main net.</p></li><li><p>POA prohibits layer 2 scaling. Most layer 2 scaling solutions aredeveloped specifically to solve the problems of the Ethereum main net.On a POA (and sidechain), you&#x2019;ll not directly profit when thesetechnologies get rolled out. Instead you&#x2019;ll have to spend significanttime and money to customize them.</p></li></ol><h2 id="misc.">Misc.</h2><ol type="1"><li>Building tools and deploying a POA network is work. In fact, it&#x2019;s adistraction. The money you spend on customizing and deploying your POAwill be wasted once you ship to main net. As outlined before, it willput the engineers in the wrong mind set. It&#x2019;s distracting them fromshipping the best product they possibly can, I&#x2019;d argue.</li></ol><h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2><p>I outline a few possible solutions that remove POA (but not sidechains) from the equation.</p><ol type="1"><li><p>Ship to main net and wait for e.g. ETH 2.0/Polkadot. Leastcostly. Best security guarantees. Bad performance. UX will be painfulbut improving rapidly as you can profit from the community makingprogress (e.g. meta-transactions). Full focus on shipping productthough. No distractions. You&#x2019;ll profit from composability and projectsintegrating.</p></li><li><p>Ship to main net and investigate alternatives to POA that offerbetter security guarantees to users (e.g. Loom Network is shipping dPoS&#x2014; node operators actually lose money when they misbehave). Not thatcostly, I imagine. Better performance than main net. Better securityguarantees. UX will be same as POA. You won&#x2019;t profit from main netinnovation as much.</p></li><li><p>Ship to main net and investigate Plasma as an alternative. Mostcostly and complex, I imagine. Good performance. Better securityguarantees than POA. You&#x2019;ll profit from the innovation going intoPlasma. UX will be as bad as POA but through community innovation willincrease at rapid pace.</p></li><li><p>Ship to main net and consider L2 via e.g. Raiden. Costly ascontracts have to be adjusted. Good performance. Better securityguarantees than POA. Innovation in UX through community at rapidpace.</p></li></ol><p>All the solutions outlined come as &#x201C;off the shelf&#x201D; to some degree andwith security guarantees similar to main net. They&#x2019;re all more or lessshipping today.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this post I argue for why shipping a public POA network is a badchoice when planning to go permission-less in the future by highlightingthe security and UX challenges users will face. I give alternativesolutions to POA.</p><p><em>(This article was originally posted on <a href="https://medium.com/@timdaub/why-you-shouldnt-ship-to-a-poa-network-7e2b5aa83aa9">medium.com</a>)</em></p>]]></content>
